            "summary": "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Saturday ruled out the delivery of long-range precision to Ukraine in the future regardless of decisions made by NATO allies.\nHe made the comments while responding to questions at a citizen's dialogue event in the town of Prenzlau in Germany's eastern state of Brandenburg.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been requesting long-range weapons so that Ukrainian forces can attack Russian logistics and military airfields far behind the front line..\nScholz said that the delivery of Taurus cruise missiles would entail \"a great risk of escalation\" of the Ukraine conflict.\nTaurus cruise missiles have a range of around 500 kilometers (310,6 miles), which would allow Ukraine to strike targets in Moscow.\n\"I said no to that,\" Scholz asserted. \"And of course that also applies to other weapons, if we had supplied them, which could reach this long distance.\"\n\"That remains the case,\" Scholz said, adding that this would not change \"even if other countries decide differently.\"\nScholz's comments come after US President Joe Biden hinted that Washington could lift restrictions on Ukraine's use of long-range Western weapons to hit sites within Russian territory..\nPresident Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer held talks on the topic at the White House on Friday afternoon, but the pair did not signal any decision on the topic.\nAt the same event in Prenzlau, Scholz said that Berlin seeks to prosecute the perpretrators of an attack on the Nord Stream gas pipelines.\n\"That was a terroristic act,\" Scholz said, adding that his government had called on security authorities and public prosecutors to continue investigatiosn into the incident.\n\"We want to bring those who did this, if we can get a hold of them, to court in Germany,\" he said, adding that there would be no \"leniency\" in this case.\nThe Nord Stream pipelines from Russia to Germany were blown up in autumn of 2022.\nIn August, Germany issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian suspect that had been living in Poland in connection with the case. The suspect has not been arrested.\nScholz stressed that Russia had already stopped gas deliveries through the pipeline before the attack. He said that replacing Russian gas with other source shad cost Germany substantially more than \u20ac100 billion ($110.8 billion).\nsdi/rm (dpa, Reuters)",

Also on Sunday, a firefighter died in action in Austria, a spokesperson for the fire department in the region of Lower Austria confirmed to CNN.\nIt comes after four people died in Romania, where the rainfall left hundreds stranded in flooded areas.\n'The effects were most critical in seven localities,' Romania's Interior Minister C\u0103t\u0103lin Predoiu told CNN affiliate Antena 3.

Klodzko, a town of 25,000, was left partially submerged in water on Sunday.\nPoland's Prime Minister, Donald Tusk told reporters Sunday: 'We have the first confirmed death by drowning, here in the Klodzko County.'\n'The situation is still very dramatic in many place,' he added. 'Unfortunately, these situations are repeating themselves in many places\u2026 but some residents sometimes underestimate the level of threat and refuse to evacuate.'\nSignificant flooding is expected to continue in the Czech Republic, where authorities have ordered mandatory evacuations for some areas.

Flood warnings have been issued for rivers in the state of Saxony.\nIn neighboring Austria, heavy rainfall has caused water levels to rise in several rivers and rescue services have been called out to parts of the country. Many municipalities in Lower Austria have declared a state of emergency as heavy rainfall continued into Sunday.\nRed alerts, the highest level of warning, have been issued for portions of Poland, Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria and Slovakia. This level of alert is associated with 'intense meteorological phenomena' and 'major damage is likely,' according to Meteoalarm.\nCNN meteorologists Taylor Ward, Allison Chinchar, and Elliana Hebert contributed to this report.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",

The residency ran from August 2 to August 31, 2024, in an 80,000-seat outdoor arena. Following the final show, the screen was dismantled, with Solotech planning to repurpose sections of it for future installations and live events.\nGuinness World Records adjudicator Joanne Brent commented, 'I was intrigued to see how such an expansive and seamless screen would be utilized during the concert. The bespoke visual effects, tailored to each song, truly elevated the performance adding an undeniable 'wow' factor.'\n\"This Munich residency is unlike anything that has ever been done before,\" noted Ian Woodall, Solotech's director of global touring and special projects.\n\"There was no template, no comparison - only possibilities. What makes this show groundbreaking isn't just the scale of the record-breaking LED screen, but the innovative thinking that made it possible. This production redefines how live entertainment can be experienced. Working alongside Adele's visionary team and all the other top-tier suppliers, we were able to push beyond the limits of what anyone thought was possible. It's this spirit of collaboration and innovation that made the Guinness World Records for the Largest Outdoor LED Screen achievable.'",

Meanwhile, Benz & Cia was led by Carl and Bertha Benz, who are credited with creating the world's first patent for an automobile.\nBefore embarking on her historic journey, Bertha Benz was already a significant figure in the automotive industry. She invented brake pads and financed the development of the Benz Patent-Motorwagen, the world's first automobilem according to EL Economista.\nDespite her pivotal role, Carl Benz received most of the recognition. Bertha, however, remained determined to prove the vehicle's practicality.\nIn 1888, Bertha took a bold step to showcase the vehicle's capabilities.\nWithout informing her husband, she set out on what is considered the first long-distance car trip. Accompanied by her children, Bertha drove from Mannheim to Pforzheim, a distance of approximately 100 kilometers (62 miles), in a journey that took 40 hours.\nAlso read\nEuropean EV-Market Suffers Setback as Battery Supplier Faces Cutbacks\nThe trip was fraught with challenges. At the time, gasoline was not widely available, and Bertha had to use ligroin, a petroleum derivative sold in pharmacies.\nAdditionally, the vehicle's 2.5-horsepower engine struggled with hills, and mechanical issues with the transmission, brakes, and fuel system complicated the journey. Despite these obstacles, Bertha successfully completed the trip, demonstrating the vehicle's reliability and paving the way for its commercial success.\nIn recognition of her pioneering spirit, the Bertha Benz Memorial Route was established in Germany, retracing her historic journey through the Black Forest. The route includes a visit to the \"first gas station in the world\" in Heilbronn, where Bertha purchased ligroin.\nThis route celebrates Bertha Benz's contribution to the automotive industry and her role in shaping its future.\nAlso read\nSlowdown in European EV Registrations Threatens Industry Targets\nLEGO Builds a Life-Sized McLaren P1 That Actually Drives\nNew Solar Roof Adds 1,500 Miles to Electric Cars",

            "summary": "India's Neeraj Chopra finished second in the Diamond League Final on Saturday, September 14 behind Paris Olympics bronze medallist Anderson Peters in the men's javelin competition. Participating at the King Baudouin Stadium in Brussels Neeraj threw his best attempt at 87.86 meters, only 0.1m behind Peters.\nOn a cold night in Brussels, where temperatures ranged between 10-13 degrees Celsius, Neeraj finished as runner-up in the Diamond League for the second year in a row. Back in 2023, Neeraj had fallen short of defending his Diamond Trophy, after losing to Czech Republic's Jakub Vadlejch. In that event, Neeraj had thrown 83.80m, while Vadlejch had won the title with 84.24m. On the day, Neeraj did better than last year at Eugene but lost the title by a whisker to Grenada's Anderson Peters.\nNeeraj had started off the event strong with a throw of 86.82 meters, only behind Grenada's Anderson Peters. Chopra was just a little over 1 meter short behind Peters' first throw of 87.87m. The Indian javelin star was not able to better his distance with his second throw (83.49m) but hit back in the third, with a mega throw of 87.86m.\nDiamond League 2024 Final: Men's javelin highlights\nWhile Anderson Peters did not improve his first throw in his third attempt, Neeraj kept himself in the hunt, trailing by just 0.1m to Peters.\nThe duo were head and shoulders above the rest of the pack, with only Germany's Julian Weber staying close to the duo with his first throw of 85.97m. The German, former European champion, slowly faded away from the competition in his next throws, hitting 82.61m, 82.15m and 81.46m in his next three attempts.\nWhile the India fans expected Neeraj to overtake Anderson Peters, Neeraj fell short on his fourth try with an attempt of 82.04m. The star Indian athlete looked concerned at times while returning back from his mark. The Indian star was not able to better himself in the last two throws, registering 83.30m and 86.46m in his final two attempts.",

            "summary": "Free agent Joel Matip is said to favour joining an English club amidst interest from West Ham. The Cameroonian centre-back has not had a club since his contract expired at Liverpool earlier this summer but is now seemingly ready to get back into first-team action.\nWest Ham have struggled so far this season winning just one game under Julen Lopetegui while also keeping just a single clean sheet. This is after the club spent over \u00a3120 million in the transfer window, but their business doesn't appear to be over.\nMatip was a great servant for Liverpool throughout his eight years at Anfield, although he did suffer his fair share of injuries. The defender is 34 years old, so those knocks and muscle injuries could become far more regular occurrences as the football calendar continues to be filled up.\nThe Hammers are already just three points above the drop zone having won one of their opening four league games. What is more worrying, is the fact they've shipped six goals in the Premier League, despite having \u00a340 million Max Kilman at the heart of their defence.\nAccording to reports, West Ham could soon be handed a defensive boost, with Matip keen to remain in the Premier League. However, the Hammers are not alone in their pursuit of the veteran defender with clubs in both England and Germany keen to secure his services.\nThe same report claims that whoever signs Matip in the coming days or weeks will have to hand him a two-year deal and not a short-term one. This is what's seemingly holding up the defender from landing a new club, his long-term contract demands.\nIt's believed that the likes of Bournemouth and Fulham are interested in Matip's services and experience, but he could have a tempting offer from abroad. Bundesliga champions and Champions League outfit, Bayer Leverkusen, are ready to move for the defender to aid their battle across several competitions this season.\nMatip has 150 games worth of experience in the Premier League and won pretty much all you could during his time on Merseyside. The departure of Jurgen Klopp may have counted towards the decision not to renew his contract, but it would be huge for the defender to stay in England and land a longer-term deal.",

I want to say thank you to Leah for this fight, I know she was promised a title fight and she didn't have to take this fight and I'm really glad she did,' said Collins.The co-main event saw Briton Simeon Powell earn a narrow split decision win over German light-heavyweight Rafael Xavier.There was also an impressive victory on the undercard for fellow British light-heavyweight Like Trainer, who submitted Lithuania's Laurynas Urbonavicius in the first round via a rear-naked choke.",

The words there of Carlota Ciganda as she closed out her and Emily Pedersen's 2&1 win over Lexi Thompson and Ally Ewing yesterday evening. Well, as far as Europe are concerned, it better be. What a tall order. But at least the omens are good, because Europe were 10-4 down in the 2012 Ryder Cup on Saturday afternoon with two matches left out on the course, and reduced the arrears to 10-6 ahead of the Sunday singles, which is exactly what the Europeans did yesterday when things were threatening to go seriously south at the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club in Virginia. So let's remember what happened after that Ryder Cup comeback 12 years ago \u2026\n\u2026 but while Ciganda brought that one up, it'd be a shocking dereliction of duty not to point out that the Solheim Cup has one of these Sunday stunners of its own. In 2015, at St Leon-Rot in Germany, Europe held a 10-6 lead going into the singles, only to capitulate to an 8\u00bd-3\u00bd defeat and a 14\u00bd-13\u00bd loss overall.\nEurope's pain that day is obviously why Ciganda preferred to reference Medinah, but there are also a couple of other reasons why St Leon-Rot is not exactly analogous. The USA needed an extra half-point to win back the trophy that year (as holders, Europe only need eight to retain it this time), and it all happened in the heightened wake of the awful rules brouhaha involving Suzann Pettersen the night before. So \u2026 OK, I'll fess up, I'm not exactly sure what point I'm making here \u2026 but you can look at Medinah and St Leon-Rot at different wonky angles through a smudged prism and argue that history either gives Europe hope, or simply shows the USA \u2013 this time fuelled by stopping their opponents from becoming the first side to lift the cup four times in a row, rather than the injustice of a technical imbroglio \u2013 will easily walk this home. QED? Nope! Nah! But the USA are obviously strong favourites.\nHere are the tee times. It might be a procession. It might be a comeback for the ages. Either way, a fantastic team of world-class talent will lift the Solheim Cup when it all comes down. God speed, everyone, and may the best women win.

            "summary": "PRAGUE (AP) \u2014 Another night of torrential rains pounding Central Europe forced massive evacuations in the hardest hit areas in the Czech Republic, where floods reached extreme levels on Sunday.\nMeteorologists have warned the situation still might get worse as waters in most rivers are rising, the flood wave made its way through the country and more heavy rains could return overnight.\nAuthorities declared the highest flood warnings in almost 90 places across the country and in two northeastern regions that recorded the biggest rainfall in recent days, including the Jeseniky mountains near the Polish border.\nIn the city of Opava, up to 10,000 people out of the population of some 56,000 have been asked to leave their homes for higher ground. Rescuers used boats to transport people to safety in a neighbourhood flooded by the raging Opava River.\n'There's no reason to wait,' Mayor Tom\u00e1\u0161 Navr\u00e1til told the Czech public radio. He said the situation was worse than during the last devastating floods in 1997, known as the 'flood of the century.'\nAt least four missing and villages cut off\nThousands of others also were evacuated in the towns of Krnov and Cesky Tesin.

[+] October 5th-6th.\nThe stage is set for what has been referred to as the 'Oscars of Spirit Competitions.' Back in April, the San Francisco World Spirits Competition convened for its annual multi-day judging. Since then, we've seen a steady rollout of all the Double Gold winners minted during that time. To receive the honor, multiple judges must score an expression 90-or-higher out of 100. There have been hundreds of examples across a dozen spirit categories. But now it's time to get down to the nitty-gritty.\nWe've been waiting patiently for the 'Best In Show,' the absolute top title amongst all 2024 spirits entries. It will finally be revealed on the weekend of October 5th in SF at a ticketed event called Top Shelf. We've got your sneak peek at that industry extravaganza\u2014including how to land yourself a seat, and an exclusive preview of the finalists for that coveted Best In Show crown, which are revealed at a grand gala on the second evening.\nIn the running for top spirit of the year are five separate expressions of single malt scotch. The distillery's behind each one are entirely familiar to category enthusiasts, with some of the releases enjoying regular placement on US liquor store shelves. A couple of the others\u2014not so much.\nBut enough throat clearing. The envelope please...\nGlendronach distillery, Forgue, Aberdeenshire. 1968. (Photo by Daily Record/Mirrorpix via Getty ...

The event was originally launched last year in Las Vegas by San Francisco Spirits Competition's parent organization, The Tasting Alliance. 2024 marks the first time that it'll be hosted in the competition's home city. And it looks to be the biggest incarnation yet; a fusion of consumer and trade featuring multiple tasting rooms, dozens of master classes, and over 80 different brands with liquids on offer.\nThis time around those master classes will include one on small batch American whiskey hosted by Brother's Bond co-founder Ian Somerhalder. There's a seminar on the art of independent bottling from Richard Urquhart of Gordon & MacPhail. Leo Gibson, co-founder of Bhakta Spirits takes people on a journey through the Armagnac Category. And Ewan Morgan, national luxury ambassador for Diageo, will lead lucky attendees through some of the rarest scotches from formerly shuttered sites known as Ghost Distilleries.\nVIP entrance, which include a token to attend one of these masterclasses\u2014along with early access and gourmet food pairings\u2014go for $300 per ticket. But they are currently available at 40% off by using the discount code, 'WHISKEY40' at checkout.\nSAUSALITO, CALIFORNIA - OCTOBER 24: Visitors look at the San Francisco skyline from a vista point ...

            "summary": "Entering Skypark last Saturday during the Multicultural Fair, I heard the first words from 'The Lion King' being sung by students, doing their best rendition of 'The Circle of Life.' Being blasted by 95-plus-degree temperatures, I surmised the production had thought of everything, even importing the searing heat from the African Savanna or Serengeti. Impressive, but even more so was their dedicated attention to their craft and the joy they were giving to their audience.\nI stood back and regarded the very interesting configuration of the different booths that beckoned the visitors, each with their unique cultural offerings. Peru, Palestine, Iran, Ireland, India and many more countries were represented and captured the attention of a very large and curious crowd. Children love crafts, activities and fun and there were plenty to choose from as the diverse settings garnered the attention of countless kids. 'SVHS Unity Starts Here Club' and the 'Asian American Pacific Islander Club' were entertaining lots of visitors. And impressively, the planning and execution of this event was driven mostly by the high school students.\nMy high school experience typically offered a United Nations Day, where the guys would dress up in a suit and tie to discuss and debate solutions to a meaty subject or two like, 'Will East and West Germany ever re-unite?' or 'Is World Peace Possible?' A little contrived. The Multicultural Fair was different. Much more purposeful, organic and real. My John Lennon 'Imagine' moment asked: What if we dropped these kids onto the world stage and let them solve an international issue or two? Dreamin'? Standing on that field, if you listened, there was a whisper of love, hope and peace, as if on this day, all things were possible. Who knows? President Clinton was poignant when he stated, 'More unites us than divides us.' It's hard, but don't stop believing.\nAs mentioned, the day was hot and that meant a trip to Santa Cruz for some relief. After a smash burger at West End Tap, we drove another half mile to West Cliff, where we got only a micro-dose of cool air, but it was sufficient to continue a walk. A drive down the coast led us to East Cliff and right around Sunny Cove, there it was: not one, not two, but three 12-year-olds riding on the same e-bike with no helmets, on the sidewalk, going the wrong way. Wow. Talk about a clear and present danger to themselves and to drivers.\nAbout a month ago, I brought up this topic at a City Council meeting and it must have hit a nerve as many in the chamber, like me, have had close encounters with these silent, but swift little machines. A councilmember even had one hit her car as she pulled away from a stop sign. My initial remedy was to have our police hold a morning instructional seminar to be attended by unlicensed riders/drivers, to help reduce the possibility of injury. The very real question is should these young riders be required to have some sort of formal permit? Sadly, I read where a couple of young dirt e-bike riders were seriously injured in Santa Cruz, so the problem is real.\nOn Scotts Valley Drive, I recently saw a couple of high school students riding on an e-bike. The passenger clung to the driver with one hand and in the other she carried a pastry and a latte. (Well-balanced but a little dangerous.) She had a helmet, but the driver did not. Stopped at the light, in a polite voice, I admonished her that she should be wearing a helmet. 'We only have one,' was her response and with the green light scooted down Glenwood Drive toward the high school. Probably going to need a little more help from the parents on this problem as the cautionary request of 'Be safe,' is not being heard.\nRandy L. Johnson is the mayor of Scotts Valley.",

            "excerpt": "Winslet strongly conveys Miller's tough-broad magnetism in this sobering, visually striking drama by cinematographer turned director Ellen Kuras",
            "summary": "More than most people, the American photographer Lee Miller \u2013 played here by a fierce and committed Kate Winslet \u2013 understood the vulnerability of being a woman in front of a camera. A model since childhood (first for her father, a keen amateur snapper, then as a fashion model, then as a muse and artistic collaborator with the surrealist artist Man Ray), Miller learned about photography from both sides of the lens. She knew from experience that taking a picture can be a kind of theft, a one-way transaction in which the subject gives a part of themselves but receives very little in return.\nThis sobering, serious-minded partial biopic, which focuses on Miller's stint as a war correspondent during the second world war, makes a case that her insight into the power dynamics of photography contributed to the extraordinary potency of her work. Her status as both a victim (her childhood rape is revealed in a jarringly clumsy exchange with her friend and employer, Vogue editor Audrey Withers, played by Andrea Riseborough) and a survivor brought her an unusual empathy with her subjects. She saw the micro-details of combat in a way that her male counterparts frequently overlooked \u2013 not just the role played by the unheralded everywoman on the street, but also the shame and humiliation felt by those whom the war had chewed up and spat out along the way. The directorial debut of American cinematographer Ellen Kuras (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), Lee is not the most formally daring or original biopic. It is, however, undeniably impactful: a woman's-eye view of a photographer who cast a woman's eye over the war and its aftermath.\nIt's a remarkable performance from Winslet, who, while she's a touch too old for the role (Miller was in her mid-30s when she covered the war), captures the spirit of the character: the brawling, confrontational tough-broad aspects of Miller's personality, as well as her considerable magnetism. Winslet's Lee is a woman who uses her words as weapons, delivered in a hardboiled screwball heroine's rasp of a voice. It's a voice that is employed extensively. A fictional interview device \u2013 a chain-smoking, whisky-swilling older Lee is interrogated by a younger man (Josh O'Connor) \u2013 provides a narration that ties together her war experiences.\nBut Winslet's performance goes deeper than the 'drinking, fucking and taking photographs' that Miller lists as her core skillset at the film's opening, which unfolds at a bohemian pool party in France on the brink of war. She balances the tough-cookie determination that took Miller to a frontline that was, nominally at least, off-limits to women, with a sense of the psychological injuries she accrued.\nAlong with her friend and colleague, Life magazine photographer David E Scherman (Andy Samberg), Miller was one of the very first civilians to bear witness to the atrocities of the Nazi concentration camps at Buchenwald and Dachau. What she saw there haunted her for the rest of her life \u2013 something that Winslet conveys in a single, wordless scene in which she sifts through her contact sheets, her ever-present cigarette burning down to its filter and a cloud gathering in her eyes.\nNot surprisingly given Kuras's background as a cinematographer, Lee is largely visually driven. Adapted from the biography The Lives of Lee Miller, written by her son, Antony Penrose, the film also benefits from extensive access to Miller's private archives, a gift of a resource for a film-maker that enables Kuras to see the world literally through the eyes of her subject. Notable photographs \u2013 some famous, some less so \u2013 are threaded organically through the film. Meanwhile, the use of colour \u2013 there's a stark contrast between the frivolous, saturated hues of prewar life and the purgatorial greys of postwar Germany \u2013 gives a neat indication of Lee's mental state at any given time.\nThe film's soundtrack, however, is less successful. The score, by Alexandre Desplat, is a bustling, busy orchestral mulch, so generic that it might as well have been pulled out of a drawer marked 'prestige period pieces'. When so much elsewhere in the picture makes such an effort to tap into the distinctive and highly unusual character of Lee Miller, the music choices feel throwaway and thoughtless in comparison.\nIn UK and Irish cinemas",

            "summary": "PRAGUE (AP) \u2014 Another night of torrential rains pounding Central Europe forced massive evacuations in the hardest hit areas in the Czech Republic, where floods reached extreme levels on Sunday.\nMeteorologists have warned the situation still might get worse as waters in most rivers are rising, the flood wave made its way through the country and more heavy rains could return overnight.\nAuthorities declared the highest flood warnings in almost 90 places across the country and in two northeastern regions that recorded the biggest rainfall in recent days, including the Jeseniky mountains near the Polish border.\nIn the city of Opava, up to 10,000 people out of a population of around 56,000 have been asked to leave their homes for higher ground. Rescuers used boats to transport people to safety in a neighborhood flooded by the raging Opava River.\n'There's no reason to wait,' Mayor Tom\u00e1\u0161 Navr\u00e1til told Czech public radio. He said that the situation was worse than during the last devastating floods in 1997, known as the 'flood of the century.'\n'We have to focus on saving lives,' Prime Minister Petr Fiala told Czech public television on Sunday. His government was to possibly meet Monday to assess the damages.\nThe worst 'is not behind us yet,' the prime minister warned.\nThousands of others also were evacuated in the towns of Krnov, which was almost completely flooded, and Cesky Tesin. The Oder River that flows to Poland was reaching extreme levels in the city of Ostrava and in Bohumin, prompting mass evacuations.\nOstrava, the regional capital is the third-largest Czech city. Its mayor, Jan Dohnal, said the city is facing major traffic disruptions in the days to come. Almost no trains were operating in the region.\nTowns and villages in the Jeseniky mountains, including the local center of Jesenik, were inundated and isolated by raging waters that turned roads into rivers. The military sent a helicopter to help with evacuations.\nJesenik mayor Zdenka Blistanova told Czech public television that several houses in her and other nearby towns have been destroyed by the floods. A number of bridges and roads have been also badly damaged.\nFour people who were swept away by waters were missing, police said.\nAbout 260,000 households were without power Sunday morning in the entire country, while traffic was halted on many roads, including the major D1 highway.\nA firefighter died after 'slipping on stairs' while pumping out a flooded basement in the town of Tulln, the head of the fire department of Lower Austria Dietmar Fahrafellner told reporters on Sunday.\nAuthorities declared the entire state of Lower Austria a disaster zone, while emergency personnel have so far evacuated 1,100 houses there.\n'We are experiencing difficult and dramatic hours in Lower Austria. For many people in Lower Austria these will probably be the most difficult hours of their lives,' said Johanna Mikl-Leitner, the governor of Lower Austria.\nIn Vienna, the Wien River overflowed its banks, flooding homes and forcing first evacuations of houses in the river's proximity.\nRomanian authorities said Sunday that another person had died in the hard-hit eastern county of Galati after four were reported dead there a day before, following unprecedented rain.\nIn Poland, one person was presumed dead in floods in the southwest, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Sunday.\nTusk said the situation was 'dramatic' around the town of Klodzko, with about 25,000 residents, located in a valley in the Sudetes mountains near the border with the Czech Republic.\nIn Glucholazy, rising waters overflowed a river embankment and flooded streets and houses. Mayor Pawe\u0142 Szymkowicz said, 'we are drowning,' and appealed to residents to evacuate to high ground.\nEnergy supplies and communications were cut off in some flooded areas, and regions may resort to using the satellite-based Starlink service, Tusk said.\nSeveral Central European nations have been hit by severe flooding, including Romania, Austria, Germany, Slovakia and Hungary, as a result of a low-pressure system from northern Italy dumping heavy rainfall in the region.\nThe weather change arrived following a hot start to September in the region. Scientists have documented Earth's hottest summer, breaking a record set just a year ago.\nA hotter atmosphere, driven by human-caused climate change, can lead to more intense rainfall.\n___\nMonika Scislowska in Warsaw, Poland, Philipp-Moritz Jenne and Stephanie Liechtenstein in Vienna, and Stephen McGrath in Sibiu, Romania, contributed to this report.",

            "excerpt": "The anniversary of Norman Lamont's failure is a timely reminder to Labour not to have its fiscal agenda set by the opposition",
            "summary": "Monday will be the 32nd anniversary of Black Wednesday. For younger readers, and older ones with ailing memories, Black Wednesday, on 16 September 1992, was the day the Tories lost their reputation for economic competence.\nTrue, they had lost it once before, when the Heath government of 1970-74 fell victim to the inflationary impact of the 1973-74 oil crisis, their economic boom that got out of control, and what became known as the disaster of the three-day week.\nBut it did not take long for the Wilson/Callaghan Labour governments of 1974-79 to fall foul in turn of the same accusation. Public borrowing started to spiral and Labour had to go 'cap in hand' to be rescued by a loan from the International Monetary Fund.\nIn came the Thatcher government of 1979-90, followed by the Major government of 1990-97. I have written extensively about what I regard as the mistakes of the Thatcher period, but it was the enforced exit of the pound from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) on Black Wednesday that was universally agreed to have put an end to the Conservatives' reputation for economic competence.\nThose were pre-euro days, and the principal motive of Lawson and Major was to tie the pound's fortunes to the Deutschmark, postwar Germany having had a well-deserved reputation for controlling inflation.\nUnfortunately, our entry could hardly have been worse timed. German inflation took off as a result of the enormous cost of absorbing the east German economy under the process of reunification \u2013 itself a welcome and historic event.\nThe fact of the matter was that the pound had been attached to the D-mark at the wrong time, at the wrong exchange rate, and for the wrong reasons. The Lawson boom of 1988-89 had led to the second worst recession since the second world war, but the high interest rates imposed by the Bundesbank, the German central bank, to combat German inflation were holding back other members of the ERM.\nAt a meeting of European finance ministers and central bank governors in Bath, Norman Lamont, who had succeeded Major as chancellor, tried to bully the Germans into reducing interest rates and therefore the pressure on the pound. Dr Helmut Schlesinger, the president of the Bundesbank, took strong exception to this. The German view was that the pound was overvalued, and that it was up to the British to deal with that problem.\nTo cut a long story short \u2013 and the markets were going short of the pound \u2013 the belief that the UK could not maintain an overvalued currency became overwhelming, and speculation forced the pound out of the ERM. This eased our economy's competitive position, and economic recovery became sustainable. The following Sunday I suggested in my column that Schlesinger should be given a knighthood for having helped the British economy to escape from recession.\nWell, I can report that, although he was never awarded that honour, my friend Helmut Schlesinger is in fine fettle, and recently celebrated his 100th birthday.\nWithin months, Lamont said he had been 'singing in the bath' as a result of the easing of economic conditions. (He had certainly not being singing in Bath after his humiliating experience.) But Major had not been amused by the way Lamont had handled the Bath meeting, and replaced him with Kenneth Clarke, who handed over an economy in reasonable shape to Gordon Brown in 1997.\nSign up to Observed\nAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers\nafter newsletter promotion\nThere are swings and roundabouts in economic policy, and it was Labour's turn again to lose its reputation in 2010, when the Conservatives launched a brilliant, and deeply cynical, campaign to accuse Labour and its supposed overspending for having caused the 2007-09 financial crisis, when it was \u2013 as the then top Treasury official at the time, Sir Nicholas (now Lord) Macpherson, pointed out \u2013 'a banking crisis, pure and simple'.\nThe result of that successful propaganda is that the current chancellor, my (almost) new friend Rachel Reeves, is obsessed by the perceived need to win back a reputation for economic competence. Unfortunately, so far she has been going about it the wrong way: penalising the poor while threatening tax increases for rich investors whom she is supposed to be wooing for investment in the UK.\nWe await her first budget on 30 October. What she should be doing is taking a long-term view of borrowing for investment that should benefit future generations, and a long-, medium- and short-term view that we should apply to re-enter the European customs union and single market as soon as possible, thereby fulfilling the promise in the Labour manifesto (do older readers remember that?) to reduce barriers to trade \u2013 of which the most glaringly obvious is Brexit.",

            "summary": "Manchester City have received a boost in their pursuit of Bayern Munich attacking midfielder Jamal Musiala, according to reports.\nThe 21-year-old is widely considered to be one of the best young players in Europe and after an impressive Euro 2024 campaign there is a battle underway for his signature.\nMusiala has been in talks with Bayern Munich over a new contract. His current deal is set to expire in 2026 and the German giants want to tie him down for the long term.\nHowever, according to the Mirror (cited by The Express), Musiala has 'rejected' Bayern's latest contract offer as he feels the pay packet falls short of what he deserves.\nIt's claimed that the youngster is holding out for \u00a3300,000 per week, which 'advisors believe represents his true value following his displays this summer.'\nMan City are now 'favourites' to sign Musiala next year when Bayern could be forced to sell him or risk losing him on a free in the summer of 2026.\nBayern haven't given up on talks though and Vincent Kompany is determined to keep Musiala in Munich. They reportedly value the player at \u00a3120m \u2013 which will price most clubs out of a move.\nREAD MORE: Arne Slot 'connection' cited as Liverpool rival Man City for \u20ac80m star who 'vetoed' Man Utd move\nMan City's interest in Musiala has long been reported by outlets in Germany and England but they are not the only Premier League club interested in the Bayern star.\nAs we have previously reported, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United are all keen on Musiala, as well as LaLiga giants Real Madrid and Barcelona.\nAll of his suitors bar Barcelona would likely have to break their transfer record to sign Musiala in 2025.\nMan City are reportedly favourites to sign Musiala at this stage. Pep Guardiola is keen to bring in a long-term replacement for Kevin de Bruyne, whose contract expires at the end of this season.\nAmid interest from Saudi Arabia it seems unlikely that the 33-year-old will pen an extension at the Etihad, so the Cityzens could make a big-money move for Musiala next summer to replace him.\nBayern will continue to try and tie Musiala down to fresh terms over the next few months but that has so far proved difficult for the German giants.\nMeanwhile, Man City are also considering a move for Crystal Palace star Eberechi Eze, who, like Musiala, can play as an attacking midfielder or winger.\nThe England star is also being watched by Tottenham and Man Utd. He will be available for \u00a368m next summer due to a release clause in his contract, making him much cheaper than Musiala.\nBayer Leverkusen superstar Florian Wirtz is also of interest to Man City but it would take a huge fee of around \u00a3130m to lure him away from Xabi Alonso's side.\nWirtz also plays as a number 10 or winger so it's clear that is an area which the Cityzens are looking to bolster next summer.\nBayern Munich's president Herbert Hainer is confident that Musiala WILL sign a new contract with Bayern, however, and that he could be at the club 'for 20 years.'\n'Many say that he will one day be the best player in the world. In that regard, we will do everything we can to secure him with FC Bayern long-term,' Hainer said.\n'In my opinion, he could easily become the next Thomas Muller and play here for the next 20 years. I'm very optimistic that we'll see him at Bayern for a long time to come.'\nMusiala was on the books at Chelsea as a youth player before he joined Bayern as a 16-year-old after the Bavarian giants agreed a compensation package for the youngster worth around \u00a3170,000 (\u20ac200,000).\nChelsea's chiefs will no doubt regret losing the talented attacking midfielder as he has gone on to become one of the Bundesliga's biggest stars in recent years.\nMusiala made his senior Bayern debut in 2019 but had to wait until the 2020/21 campaign to get a regular slot in the first team. He has since 167 appearances for the German club, scoring an impressive 45 goals and making 31 assists in the process.\nLast season, the German international made an average of 2.4 shots and 1.8 key passes per game \u2013 displaying his ability to create chances for his team.\nMusiala has made an excellent start to this season with two goals in three Bundesliga games so far and will hope that he can help fire his team to the title.\nThe youngster is only expected to improve and may well become one of the world's best players if his career continues on its current trajectory.\nDON'T MISS: The key contract details of every Liverpool first-team player: Expiry dates, weekly wages, agents\u2026",

            "summary": "(Bloomberg) -- It took BMW AG more than two years to discover the extent of a braking system fault that is expected to cost the carmaker nearly \u20ac1 billion ($1.1 billion) to fix.\nCustomers and dealers began complaining to the German auto manufacturer about faulty brakes in June 2022, according to a recall document seen by Bloomberg News. But it wasn't until last month that BMW realized as many as 1.5 million cars might contain the defective part, supplied by car-parts maker Continental AG and touted as a lighter and more efficient system.\nA profit warning last week wiped \u20ac5 billion off BMW's value, a debacle for a premium-car maker known as a driving-tech leader.\nBMW launched an in-depth review into the braking system in October 2023, the recall document shows, which found interference affecting the electric signals sent through the brake system. The first recall of about 80,000 vehicles followed in the US in February this year.\nThat has since snowballed to encompass 1.5 million cars across multiple brands made by BMW \u2014 including $420,000 Rolls-Royce Spectres, flagship 7-Series sedans and high-powered XM sport utility vehicles.\n'This isn't just an ordinary recall, this is a significant shock,' said Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, director at the Center for Automotive Research in Bochum. 'What's also noteworthy is that BMW has been stepping up quality control among suppliers with a taskforce, indicating they see risks more broadly.'\n'BMW is usually very cautious, preferring stability over short-term peaks, which is reflected in their margins,' he added.\nBy US law, carmakers risk fines if they don't report safety issues in a timely way to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In some cases a manufacturer may reasonably be unaware of a defect even after an extended period. The NHTSA hasn't fined BMW over the brakes recall.\nA spokeswoman for BMW said that it took time to gauge the scale and financial impact of the recall, adding that the automaker needed to discuss the matter with officials across multiple markets and assess how much fixes would cost.\nA recall notice Rolls-Royce sent to its American dealers in March, seen by Bloomberg News, shows the company was aware at the time that it had a problem with one of its most prestigious brands.\nIn capital letters, the luxury carmaker ordered a halt to sales and deliveries of all Spectres built between June 20, 2023 and June 23, 2023. The model's braking system was potentially faulty, and a mechanic would have to follow a 26-step process to fix affected autos.\nThe US recall eventually ballooned to 688 Spectres built between January 2023 and July 2024, more than a quarter of the vehicles produced each year. Given recalls in other markets, the total number of Spectres affected is likely higher.\nThe braking system that prompted the recall is known as brake-by-wire, which uses electronic impulses instead of the hydraulic technology built into most car brakes since the 1920s. Its components are a cornerstone product for Continental's auto unit, which is in the process of being spun off.\nYet problems soon arose with a 'power braking' feature meant to reduce the amount of force needed to activate the brakes. The feature failed to fully activate in some vehicles, according to the recall document seen by Bloomberg. Physically weaker drivers might struggle to apply the necessary pressure in emergency situations as a result, increasing the risk of a crash.\nContinental traced the defect back to a plant in Hungary. Workers producing the brakes' circuit boards there failed to maintain a sufficiently clean environment, leaving smudges or dust on the components that hampered the system's performance, according to people familiar with the matter.\nNo accidents or injuries have been reported as a result of the braking fault. But with repairs expected to take months and ultimate costs still unclear, the crisis marks the latest hit to Germany's most important industry. The sector is already under a cloud as electric-vehicle sales slow and European manufacturers face headwinds in China.

            "excerpt": "US president Joe Biden and British PM Keir Starmer fear secret arms link-up amid talks in Washington over Ukraine",
            "summary": "Britain and the US have raised fears that Russia has shared nuclear secrets with Iran in return for Tehran supplying Moscow with ballistic missiles to bomb Ukraine.\nDuring their summit in Washington DC on Friday, Keir Starmer and US president Joe Biden acknowledged that the two countries were tightening military cooperation at a time when Iran is in the process of enriching enough uranium to complete its long-held goal to build a nuclear bomb.\nBritish sources indicated that concerns were aired about Iran's trade for nuclear technology, part of a deepening alliance between Tehran and Moscow.\nOn Tuesday last week, Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, made a similar warning on a visit to London for a summit with his British counterpart, David Lammy, though it received little attention, as the focus then was the US announcement of Iran's missile supply to Moscow.\n'For its part, Russia is sharing technology that Iran seeks \u2013 this is a two-way street \u2013 including on nuclear issues as well as some space information,' Blinken said, accusing the two countries of engaging in destabilising activities that sow 'even greater insecurity' around the world.\nBritain, France and Germany jointly warned last week that Iran's stockpile of highly enriched uranium had 'continued to grow significantly, without any credible civilian justification' and that it had accumulated four 'significant quantities' that each could be used to make a nuclear bomb.\nBut it is not clear how much technical knowhow Tehran has to build a nuclear weapon at this stage, or how quickly it could do so. Working with experienced Russian specialists or using Russian knowledge would help speed up the manufacturing process, however \u2013 though Iran denies that it is trying to make a nuclear bomb.\nIran had struck a deal in 2015 to halt making nuclear weapons in exchange for sanctions relief with the US and other western nations \u2013 only for the agreement to be abandoned in 2018 by then US president and current Republican nominee Donald Trump.\nIran responded by breaching agreed limits on the quantity of enriched uranium it could hold.\nWestern concern that Iran is close to being able to make a nuclear weapon has been circulating for months, contributing to tensions in the Middle East, already at a high pitch because of Israel's continuing assault on Hamas and Gaza.\nIran and its proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah, are supporters of Hamas \u2013 and Tehran's nuclear development is therefore viewed as a direct threat by Jerusalem.\nSoon after Vladimir Putin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Iran began supplying Shahed delta winged drones to Moscow and helped Russia build a factory to make more to bomb targets across Ukraine. In April this year, Iran launched a Russian-style missile and drone attack aimed at Israel, though it was essentially prevented and stopped with the help of the US and UK.\nRussia and Iran, though not historically allies, have become increasingly united in their opposition to the west, part of a wider 'axis of upheaval' that also includes to varying degrees China and North Korea, reflecting a return to an era of state competition reminiscent of the cold war.\nLast week in London, Blinken said that US intelligence had concluded that the first batch of high-speed Iranian Fath-360 ballistic missiles, with a range of up to 75 miles (120km), had been delivered to Russia.\nAble to strike already bombarded frontline Ukrainian cities, the missiles prompted a dramatic reassessment in western thinking as well as fresh economic sanctions.\nStarmer flew to Washington late on Thursday to hold a special foreign policy summit with Biden at the White House on Friday, beginning with a short one on one in the outgoing president's Oval Office followed by a 70-minute-long meeting with both sides' top foreign policy teams in the residence's Blue Room.\nSign up to Observed\nAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers\nafter newsletter promotion\nThe leaders and their aides discussed the war in Ukraine, the crisis in the Middle East, Iran and the emerging competition with China.\nStarmer brought along with him Lammy, Downing Street's chief of staff, Sue Gray, and the UK's national security adviser, Tim Barrow, , while Biden was accompanied by Blinken and Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, among others.\nPrior to the meeting, UK sources indicated that the two countries had agreed in principle to allow Ukraine to fire long-range Anglo-French Storm Shadow missiles into Russia for the first time. But Biden appeared to suggest the topic was one of the reasons for the face-to-face, saying to reporters: 'We're going to discuss that now,' as the meeting began.\nThere was no update after the meeting, partly to keep the Kremlin guessing. Any use of the missiles is expected to be part of a wider war plan on the part of Ukraine aimed at using them to target airbases, missile launch sites and other locations used by Russia to bomb Ukraine.\nBritain needs the White House's permission to allow Ukraine to use the missiles in Russia because they use components manufactured in the US.\nProtocol dictated that Biden and Starmer \u2013 the only two present without printed-out name cards \u2013 did most of the talking, while the other politicians and officials present only spoke when introduced by the president or the prime minister.\nLammy was asked by Starmer to update those present on his and Blinken's trip to Kyiv on Thursday to meet Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\nShortly after the meeting, Starmer said the two sides had had 'a wide ranging discussion about strategy'.",

            "excerpt": "Amid questions over the declaration of clothing in the UK, how do world leaders and their spouses fund their style choices?",
            "summary": "Sir Keir Starmer and his wife Lady Victoria accepted donations of clothing so they could \"look their best\" to represent the UK, David Lammy has said.Asked about the donations, the foreign secretary suggested other countries had generous taxpayer-funded budgets for leaders' clothing.It came after reports Sir Keir may have broken parliamentary rules in failing to declare clothes bought for his wife by Labour donor Lord Waheed Alli.Lammy told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: 'US presidents and first ladies have a huge budget, paid for by the taxpayer, so that they look their best on behalf of the US people.\"In fact, the US first lady does not have access to a specific clothing budget - and many have shared frustration at the cost of staying fashionable in the White House.\nSo what are the rules around clothes for the world stage?\nIn some countries, taxpayers contribute to living expenses for their leaders - and this can include clothing. US presidents have an expenses budget of some $50,000 (\u00a338,000), which can be used to purchase clothing and other items, on top of an annual salary of $400,000.But the US president's spouse - historically, always a first lady - does not receive an annual salary or fixed expenses budget, though they have paid staff and an office.That's despite the US first lady's fashion choices attracting immense scrutiny and attention.Notable examples have included Melania Trump's Zara jacket emblazoned with 'I REALLY DON'T CARE, DO U?', on a visit to a migrant detention centre, and the striking scarlet Alexander McQueen dress worn by Michelle Obama while meeting former Chinese President Hu Jintao.\nSome first ladies have said that, in general, they were expected to pay for their clothes themselves.Mrs Bush, the wife of George W Bush, wrote in her 2010 memoir that she was 'amazed by the sheer number of designer clothes that I was expected to buy\u2026 to meet the fashion expectations for a first lady'.'After our first year in the White House, our accountant said to George, 'It costs a lot to be president,' and he was referring mainly to my clothes,' Mrs Bush wrote.Michelle Obama's press secretary, Joanna Rosholm, told CNBC in 2014: 'Mrs Obama pays for her clothing.'US first ladies can also accept clothes as gifts, often on behalf of the government. Some designers welcome the publicity their clothes being worn by the first lady offers them. With the price tags of designer dresses easily running into the tens of thousands, donations are the only way comparatively less wealthy occupants of the White House could afford to wear star designers.'For official events of public or historic significance, such as a state visit, the first lady's clothes may be given as a gift by a designer and accepted on behalf of the U.S. government,' Mrs Rosholm said.\nThe Smithsonian Museum lists the dress current first lady Jill Biden wore at her husband's 2021 inauguration as a donation of designer Alexandria O'Neil 'in honour of first lady Jill Biden' \u2013 an indication the designer lent her the dress.By contrast, it appears that her predecessor Melania Trump, whose husband's wealth made him the richest president in history, donated her inaugural dress, designed by Herv\u00e9 Pierre, herself. That may be because she paid for it.In the UK, Sarah Brown, wife of former prime minister Gordon Brown, has spoken of the difficulties around accepting gifts - including clothing - while in Downing Street.\"As I quickly discover,\" she wrote in her book. Behind the Black Door, in 2011, \"there is no shortage of designers and retailers who will offer you free clothes.\"However, there are many rules that govern what MPs (and spouses) can do with free gifts - not to mention the moral aspect of using your position to grab freebies.She explained the solution: \"No10 advisers and I figure out a way that works for everyone. Any clothes that I want to keep, I can buy. \"Any freely offered clothes or jewellery, I can effectively 'rent' for about 10 per cent of the retail value, then return.\"\nWhat about other countries?\nSpouses of world leaders elsewhere generally appear to rely on donations for their style choices. France's Brigitte Macron does not have a state-funded budget for clothes and is believed to be lent outfits by Parisian high fashion houses such as Louis Vuitton. According to the 2019 book Madame La Pr\u00e9sidente, her office keeps a record of which clothes have been donated to her and which are her own. But her husband, President Emmanuel Macron, has been criticised for his own profligate spending. This year, it was revealed that his office reserved a business class seat on a flight from Paris to Brazil solely to transport two of his suits, at a cost of nearly \u20ac4,000 (\u00a33,380).In Germany, ministers were criticised for spending \u20ac450,000 on hairdressers, makeup artists and photographers in the first six months of 2023, though there does not appear to be a specific fund for clothing.Asked about Lammy's remarks, a Foreign Office spokesman declined to comment further.Downing Street said of Sir Keir's declaration of clothing donations: \"We sought advice from the authorities on coming to office.\"We believed we had been compliant, however, following further interrogation this month, we have declared further items.\"",

            "excerpt": "The market had been gradually scaling back from speculation of a 50 bp cut this week by the Federal Reserve.",
            "summary": "cemagraphics\nThe market had been gradually scaling back from speculation of a 50 bp cut this week by the Federal Reserve. The euro and sterling tested important technical support near $1.10 and $1.30 respectively. The Dollar Index ( DXY ) set last week's high after the August CPI. However, the general tone of the markets changed, spurred at least initially by a Dow Jones story that many observers believe was likely planted by a senior Fed official to put a 50 bp cut back on the table. That set the proverbial cat among the pigeons. The odds of a 50 bp cut went up to nearly 50% fat the end of the week from less than 20% at Wednesday's settlement after the August CPI. Several former Fed officials were quoted on the newswires, sympathetic to a larger move. The dollar fell against nearly all the world's currencies in the past two sessions, and the greenback sunk to new lows for the year against the Japanese yen near JPY140.30.\nThe Federal Reserve is perceived to be reluctant to surprise the market. Many seem to expect another media story during the quiet period, where Fed officials do not talk to the media shortly before an FOMC meeting, to minimize the risk of surprise. Rarely this close to an FOMC meeting have the odds been so close to 50/50. The FOMC meeting and press conference are the key events in the coming days. The Bank of England, Norway's Norges Bank, and the Bank of Japan meet. They are not expected to move, but the market is pricing in 50 bp of cuts by the BOE and a quarter-point cut by Norges Bank before the end of the year. The swaps market has a 10 bp rate hike by the BOJ nearly discounted in December. Several emerging market central banks meet too, but the most interesting will be Brazil. Brazil's central bank began cutting the Selic rate in August 2023, and through May, it had slashed it by 325 bp to 10.50%. At the meeting on September 18, a few hours after the Federal Reserve, Brazil is expected to deliver a 25 bp rate hike. Yet, the strongest emerging market currency last week was the Mexican peso. Its 3.4% gain was nearly twice the rise of the second-best performing EM currency, the Chilean peso (+1.85%). It was the largest weekly advance of the year and came after the judicial reform was approved by Mexico's Senate and the states. AMLO's National Guard proposal will be voted on in the coming days. United States:\nBefore the FOMC meeting concludes on September 18, the August retail sales, industrial production, and housing starts will be reported. The data is unlikely to have a significant impact on market expectations for Fed policy but will help economists fine-tune Q3 GDP forecasts. We already know that August retail sales disappointed with a 15.13 mln unit (seasonally adjusted annual rate), the weakest since January. Still, of note, it was about 0.5% above the sales from August 2023. The average pace of auto sales this year is about 1% above the average in the first eight months of 2023. Industrial output may have eked out a small gain after falling by 0.6% in July. Say what one wants about re-shoring manufacturing to the US, but through August, the US has shed about 32k manufacturing jobs this year. It had gained 12k manufacturing jobs in the first eight months of 2023. Manufacturing output is flat this year through July, after having risen by 1.4% in Jan-July 2023 period. Meanwhile, housing starts are running about 5% below 2023's pace, which itself was about 13% below the 2022 pace. The Atlanta Fed's GDP tracker stands at 2.5% as of September 9 and the NY Fed tracker is at 2.6% as of September 6.\nThe FOMC meeting is momentous. It will begin the easing cycle. The key debate is size: 25 bp or 50 bp? As the market turmoil from around mid-July through early August reached a climax, the market priced in high confidence of a 50 bp cut, but as the markets stabilized, the odds were scaled back. However, a Dow Jones report on September 12, revived the speculation. Even a quarter-point cut may be delivered in a dovish fashion if there is no pushback against expectations of at least one and maybe two half-point cuts at the next two meetings (November 7 and December 18). Powell's predecessors, Bernanke, and Yellen, often played down the Summary of Economic Projections (the \"dot plot\"). Powell embraces them, refers to them, and recognizes their limitations; they are a snapshot of the different Fed officials' forecasts based on the current information set, which can become dated as the quarter progresses and there is more incoming data. Recall that the median dot in June was for one rate cut, but there were eight officials who saw two cuts being appropriate. The new median is likely to be outside of June's range, and the median dot is likely to be between 75 and 100 bp of cuts. One important consideration is whether the more aggressive profile for this year going to be front-loading what the Fed anticipated it would deliver in 2025 and 2026 or is there some additional easing anticipated. In June, the median dot had Fed funds finishing 2025 between 4.00% and 4.25%. For the end of 2026, the median dot was for Fed funds to be between 3.00% and 3.25%. The Fed funds futures currently imply about a 2.75% rate at the end of 2025 and 2.85% at the end of 2026.\nUntil the second half of last week, it did not look like the dollar's upside correction to the August slide was over. However, the Dollar Index stalled near 101.85 last week and failed to take out the previous week's high (slightly above 101.90). The Dollar Index gapped lower ahead of the weekend to set the low for the week (slightly below 100.90). The lower end of the range is 100.50. The momentum indicators are not in agreement but the risk of a 50 bp cut may deter dollar buying at the start of the new week. Japan:\nA common narrative is that the change in the trajectory of Bank of Japan monetary policy caused great market consternation. No doubt there is something there, but the correlations suggest two things: 1) the exchange rate has been more sensitive to long-term rates than short-term rates and 2) the exchange rate is more sensitive to US interest rates than Japanese interest rates (or to the changes of the spreads). The market is confident that the Bank of Japan will stand pat this week, allowing its late July rate hike and the start of QT to continue to be absorbed by businesses and investors. The swaps market has eight basis points of a hike discounted for this year and another 10 bp in the first half of next year. Despite this, the yen has remained firm. Japanese investors have continued to buy foreign assets (yen sales), while the speculators in the CME futures market continued to buy yen and extend their net long position. The BOJ will see August CPI figures before it makes its decision, but the Tokyo CPI has already been reported and this means the national report will add little new. That said, headline CPI likely rose above 3.0% for a new high since last October, after a 2.8% rate for the past three months. The core rate, which excludes fresh food, is likely to have risen for the fifth consecutive month, and at 2.6%, it also would be at the highest since last October.\nThe dollar fell to a new low for the year ahead of the weekend near JPY140.30. It was arguably dragged lower by the softer US rates. What made BOJ intervention successful was that officials were adept at picking a top to US yields as they did in 2022. Few accounts noting the seemingly effectiveness of the intervention even mention this aspect. In any event, the US 10-year yield may form a base near 3.60%, around 90 bp off the early July high. And if it holds, it may take some pressure off the dollar with the risk-reward changing as the JPY140 level was approached. It was held in late 2023, and the greenback has not traded below there since July 2023. Initial resistance may be near JPY141.00, but it may require a move above JPY141.50 to be notable. United Kingdom:\nIn late July, the swaps market flirted with a Bank of England rate cut this week, but it was on a closing basis never better than a 50/50 proposition. The odds now are seen at less than 20%. After this week's meeting, there are two more before the end of the year. The market has two cuts discounted. Two quarter-point cuts this year would bring the base rate to 4.5%. The swaps market sees the rate near 3.60% in the middle of next year. Ahead of the BOE meeting, August's CPI will be reported. The UK's headline inflation rose at an annualized pace of less than 1% in the three months through July. This likely overstates the disinflationary pressure, but there is scope for a decline in the year-over-year pace (2.2% in July) in August and September before firming in Q4 and into January 2025. The core rate has been stickier, but 1) it has not risen on a year-over-year basis since May 2023, and 2) it has been a little more than halved from 6.9% in July 2023 to 3.3% in July 2024. Services inflation has been stickier still. It was at 5.2% in July. It has fallen steadily from 6.5% pace in January. The slower growth of wages is expected to slow services inflation. Last week, the UK reported a 4.0% rise in average weekly earnings (three months, year-over-year), the slowest since late 2020. At the end of next week, August retail sales will be reported. On a volume basis, UK retail sales (including gasoline) have risen by an average of 0.6% a month. However, consumption is a much larger category and although the UK economy was the fastest growing among the G7 in H1 24, consumption looks like it may have been a drag, but it is expected to be improving this quarter, even as overall economic activity decelerates from 0.6% quarter-over-quarter in Q2 and 0.7% in Q1 24.\nSterling's pullback in the first part of last week took it to almost $1.30. This surpassed the (38.2%) retracement of the August rally but stopped short of the next retracement (50%), which is near $1.2965. Sterling benefitted from the broad pullback in the US dollar amid the speculation of a half-point cut by the Fed. It rose above $1.3150 ahead of the weekend, which itself was a retracement target of the losses sterling suffered after the US jobs data on September 6. Sterling was turned back from them and recorded the session low near $1.3115 before consolidating. We are not convinced that the bounce is the beginning of a new leg up. We suspect sterling will retest the lows near $1.30 before last month's high (~$1.3265). Still, nearby resistance is seen in the $1.3165. Eurozone:\nAfter last week's ECB rate cut and somber forecasts, this week's high-frequency data is unlikely to materially impact expectations for next month's ECB meeting. There was almost a 45% chance of an October cut discounted at the end of last week. The euro closed slightly higher on the week, and it was the sixth weekly gain in the past seven weeks, but it did not reflect good news from the eurozone. Growth in Q2 was revised to 0.2% from 0.3%, and the Germany engine is still not firing. The industry is still hobbled, as illustrated by Volkswagen's woes. German industrial production tumbled 2.4% in July (month-over-month). Its manufacturing PMI fell for three months through August to 42.4 (43.3 last December). The September ZEW survey results will be reported on September 17. After 11 consecutive months of improvement, the expectations component fell in July and August, and at 19.2 in August, it was the lowest level since January. The assessment of current conditions has moved around a bit but at -77.3 in August, it is essentially flat since the end of last year (-77.1 in December 2023). News that Germany's trade surplus unexpectedly dropped by a third in the two months through July is likely to exert a drag on the EMU trade balance due September 16.\nThe driver of the euro's exchange rate is likely to continue to be found in US developments rather than Europe. The US two-year yield has fallen considerably faster than the Germany yield, and the US premium has sunk to about 135 bp from the year's high near 205 bp in mid-April. It had risen to 150 bp in the middle of last week, after the US CPI, before taking another leg down on the renewed speculation of a 50 bp cut by the Fed. Last year, it bottomed near 112 bp and seems a reasonable medium-term target. After $1.10 held on September 11 (50% retracement of the August rally is about $1.0990), the euro rallied slightly above $1.11 to set a new high for the week ahead of the weekend. The downtrend connecting the late August and early September highs is around $1.1125 to start the new week. The high around the US jobs data was $1.1155 and the year's high set in late August was slightly above $1.12. China:\nThe Federal Reserve's rate cut and clear signal that more will be forthcoming may remove an obstacle to easing by the PBOC. In a broad dollar decline, the yuan rose to its best levels of the year. It had gotten sufficiently strong that the newswires were reporting that state-owned banks were buying dollars. The dollar recovered in the first half of last week before selling off to a four-day low before the weekend. Banks set prime rates this week, but they seem to be waiting for the PBOC to move first. How the state-owned banks relate to the state is debatable. The dominant view seems to be that when these banks operate in the foreign exchange or bond market, they are doing the bidding of the government. Yet, at the same time, those same banks have resisted pressure from Beijing to lend to property developers and to refrain from buying government bonds. If those banks bought dollars, as press reports suggest, after selling them above CNY7.25 in July, who realizes the profit? Meanwhile, since mid-May, China's CSI 300 has rallied in only three weeks and is off 5% in the past two weeks. It is back to levels seen in February, which itself as the low since early 2019. Although Chinese officials closely managed the yuan's exchange rate, it is continuing to track the yen. The yen's gains helped the offshore yuan string together a three-day advance. The dollar settled virtually unchanged on the week--slightly higher against the offshore yuan and slightly lower against the onshore yuan. Canada:\nBarring a new shock, the Bank of Canada is set to cut rates at the last two meetings of the year (Oct 23 and Dec 11), and this will likely be underscored by the record of the recent central bank meeting. In fact, this week's CPI coupled with the greater confidence in the Fed's easing cycle, could boost the chances of a 50 bp move, especially after the dismal jobs report (which saw a nearly 44k loss of full-time jobs and a jump in unemployment to 6.6% from 6.4%). Bank of Canada Governor Macklem kept the door open to this possibility last week. Consumer inflation continues to moderate. A 0.1% rise in August consumer prices will allow the year-over-year rate to fall to 2.1% from 2.5%. The three-month annualized rate would be about 1.6%. The underlying core measures are also expected to have fallen. Other data will be less impactful. Canada will report July retail sales and a bounce back after a 0.3% drop in June is expected. Portfolio flows for July will be released on September 18. In Q2, foreign investors net purchased C$67 bln of Canada's bonds and stocks. This is the most in a three-month period in a couple of years. The Toronto Stock Exchange Composite rallied nearly 5.7% in July, its best month of the year, and its second-best since November 2020 (and another 1% last month). The 10-year yield fell by 35 bp, more than the previous two months combined.\nThe US dollar extended its recovery against the Canadian dollar after a slide in August but stopped shy of the (38.2%) retracement objective near CAD1.3635. It pulled back in recent sessions but was limited to the CAD1.3565 area, which itself is a retracement target of the greenback's rally since the low from September 6 jobs report day. The greenback finished slightly firmer on the week for the second consecutive week, after a four-week slide. The momentum indicators are still constructive. Barring a break of the CAD1.3550 area, we anticipate a retest on the CAD1.3625-50 area. Australia:\nAustralia's August jobs report is the only data of note in the coming week (September 19). It may help the central bank persuade more investors that rates are unlikely to be cut soon. Despite the firm pushback against market speculation, the futures market continues to discount around an 80% chance of a cut by the end of the year. Through July, Australia has created almost 320k jobs (273 full-time posts) compared with 245k jobs (168k full-time) in the first seven months of 2023. Still, the unemployment rate has gradually risen to 4.2% from 3.9% at the end of last year. What is happening is the participation rate has risen from 66.6% at the end of 2023 to 67.1% in July. Migration has boosted Australia's population. The Australian dollar initially extended its pullback from the $0.6825 high set in late August and fell to almost $0.6620 in the middle of last week, just above the 200-day moving average. The broad setback to the US dollar saw it recover to nearly $0.6735 before the weekend. Overcoming resistance in the $0.6750-$0.6770 area could re-target the high. However, we are not convinced that the uptrend has, in fact, resumed. Mexico:\nMexico reported softer than expected CPI. The headline rate slipped to 4.99% from 5.57% in July. It was the first decline since February. Mexico's CPI bottomed last October (4.26%). The July print was the highest since May 2023. The core rate eased to 4.0% from 4.05%. It has fallen every month since January 2023, when it was at 8.45%. It has not been below 4% since February 2021. The central bank meets on September 26. Banxico cut rates in August, and the risks have increased of another cut in September. Recall that in August, it cut this year's growth forecast to 1.5% from 2.4%. The dollar settled above MXN20.00 on September 10 for the first time in two years. It looks set to move higher but posted a bearish reversal the next day by trading on both sides of the September 10 range and settled below its low. Follow-through selling before the weekend sent the greenback to nearly MXN19.19, where the (61.8%) retracement of the dollar's last leg up that began in mid-August is found. A break of that area could see MXN19.00. Given the carry (interest rate differential), it is expensive for short-term momentum and trend followers to be short without robust momentum. The controversial judicial reform was approved by both chambers of Congress and states and in the coming days, the bill regarding the National Guard will be taken up.\nOriginal Post\nEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.",

            "excerpt": "Destruction of Ukraine's energy infrastructure puts botanical garden's rare and exotic species in danger",
            "summary": "Zhanna Yaroslavska showed off a barrel-shaped stove in the middle of a tropical greenhouse. Nearby was a large pile of logs. 'It's a pretty neanderthal arrangement,' she explained. 'When the power shuts off we feed the stove with wood. In winter we do this round the clock. Our plants require constant temperatures. They don't like cold and hot.'\nInside the glass nursery were dozens of rare specimens. All were bromeliads native to the Americas. Silvery wisps of beard-like Tillandsia descended from a pipe. A pineapple poked out of a stem. A screen next to the stove protected a group of starfish-like earth stars, native to Brazil. The collection needed a minimum temperature of 10C, Yaroslavska \u2013 a senior researcher \u2013 said. Below that everything would die off.\nThe greenhouse is one of eight in the Mykola Hryshko national botanical garden in Kyiv. Founded in 1935, it is Ukraine's biggest garden and one of the largest in Europe. It is home to about 13,000 species of trees, flowers and other plants from around the world. The 52-hectare (130 acres) site has scientific departments and two laboratories. With its roses and camellias, it is a popular venue with wedding photographers.\nBut the park is now staring at disaster. In recent months, Russia has systematically destroyed most of Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Power cuts in the capital and across the country are common, with the situation getting worse. The city authorities have said they will not be able to guarantee supply in the freezing months ahead. Prices for electricity have doubled, as the garden's funding has shrunk.\n'Worst-case scenario is we lose a big part of our collection,' Roman Ivannikov, the head of the tropical and subtropical plant department, said. Money is so tight he and his colleagues recently took a pay cut. Last winter, \u00a355,000 in donations kept the garden going, allowing the purchase of 242 tonnes of fuel pellets. Volunteers chopped firewood. The garden is appealing for help, under the hashtag #greenhousewarming.\nBefore the first chilly night of October arrives, Ivannikov said his team urgently needed additional generators. The orchid house had a unique collection of exotic specimens and was especially vulnerable. Last year, three Samsung heat pumps were fitted to maintain temperatures at 20-22C. But there was no back-up in the case of a prolonged shutdown.\nIvannikov pointed out some of the collection's highlights. They included an egg-in-the-nest orchid from China \u2013 it has a strange white-and-purple-spotted flower \u2013 and a delicate green jewel orchid. Another example \u2013 Doritis pulcherrima \u2013 was descended from a plant sent into space in 1986. The orchid was part of a Soviet mission to the Mir space station, where the crew performed experiments in biology.\nThe garden collaborates with international partners. In 2014, it sent plants to Vietnam, after their original habitat was destroyed to make way for banana and coffee crops. 'I travelled with 45 orchids,' Ivannikov recalled. 'I watched on TV, as Russia took Crimea.' Scientific conferences with Moscow stopped. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion Ivannikov took his family out of Kyiv and returned a week later.\nThe Kremlin continues to fire missiles at the capital. From time to time, falling debris breaks glass in the hothouses. Blast waves from explosions have dislodged a chunk of wall and knocked over red-listed plants. 'We haven't had a direct hit. But we suffered a lot of damage,' Ivannikov said. In January, a rocket flew above the main orangery, a giant glass dome containing banks of shaggy vines and a towering king palm.\nIryna Yudakova, an engineer, was inside. 'I didn't hear the air alarm. I went out and saw a streak in the sky,' she said. 'There was an explosion. A piece of shrapnel fell next to me. Another hit a window. I was lucky.' Yudakova said she enjoyed her job but that the pay \u2013 8,000 hryvnia a month (\u00a3150) \u2013 was measly. 'Previously I was a psychologist. When the war started I lost my clients. Without my husband I couldn't survive,' she said.\nYudakova's duties include looking after the rhododendrons and azaleas. In February, one of her favourite plants \u2013 an old specimen bred in Germany in the 1930s \u2013 lost most of its leaves during a blackout. 'It got too cold,' she said. 'The younger, smaller plants survive better.' Standing next to the denuded shrub, she reflected: 'It's like losing a relative or a pet. I think of them as my kids. I water them, care for them, talk to them.'\nMany employees have worked at the garden for decades. Others fled Russian occupation. Among them are a father and daughter in charge of the bonsai collection, who escaped from Mariupol. Ivannikov said his soldier cousin died defending the eastern city, which Russia flattened in 2022. About 1,000 volunteers do various tasks. They prune lavender, remove unwanted hops and water juvenile plants.\n'It's gardening therapy. The volunteers do useful work. They go home feeling better,' Ivannikov said. Last weekend, dog walkers and young couples visited the alpine garden and sat in a pleasant outdoor cafe. A red squirrel bounded between trees. Next to the administration building \u2013 where new orchids are nurtured in glass flasks \u2013 a sale of succulents was going on. Proceeds went to Ukraine's armed forces.\nBack at the bromeliad house Yaroslavska said she would like to replace the building \u2013 constructed in 1976 under communism \u2013 with a modern, more heat-efficient version. She recognised there was no point in making improvements while the war rumbled on and bombs fell randomly from the sky. For now, the objective was for the garden and its 4,000 tropical and subtropical plants to get through the coming winter.\nThere were also smaller challenges, she said. A bold squirrel had climbed in through a ventilation window and made off with the figs from a rare tree. Apart from getting rid of the squirrel, what else did she want? 'If I had a magic wand I would wish there was no Russia,' she replied. 'No Russia means no problem. We could live normally.'",

            "summary": "'There's a joy in this city that I just really like,' Rick Steves told the audience in Music Hall, midway between his musical travelogue with the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra.\nSteves brought a dose of his own joy \u2013 of travel, history and music \u2013 to the Pops on Sept. 13, to open the orchestra season. With Steves as tour guide, conductor John Morris Russell led the Pops through an engaging trip of 19th-century music from multiple European countries.\nThe inimitable travel writer, entrepreneur and TV personality, known to millions for his PBS series and radio shows, was host and narrator for a program of romantic-era anthems, most of them greatest hits of music history. Steves provided some of the stories behind the music and how these nationalistic works inspired patriotism \u2013 and sometimes revolution -- in the populace.\nIt was a polished and stirring package, and the orchestra's musicians performed wonderfully. Steves, a classically trained pianist, even took up the baton once to conduct them. There were many standing ovations and a polite Cincinnati 'mosh pit' in the lobby afterwards as fans assembled to get his autograph.\nIn the hall were 18 cameras and a 26-foot jib swinging out over the audience, meaning that the Pops was once again in the business of TV specials. The show is being filmed live during all three concerts in partnership with CET, Cincinnati's public television station. In a few months, it will be made available to PBS stations to air across the country.\nThe show was being filmed live during all three concerts in partnership with CET. In a few months, it will be made available to PBS stations to air across the country. JP Leong\nSteves offered just enough information sprinkled with lots of humor to enhance the music we were about to hear. Wearing a suit and tie instead of his usual travel clothes and day pack, the host communicated with the same friendly and down-to-earth style that we've come to know over his career of more than 40 years. It was a show he has performed many times with orchestras, and he delivered it entirely from memory. On this night, there were no 'bloopers' \u2013 the take-outs that often appear at the ends of his PBS travel shows.\nThe program opened with a mellow arrangement of 'America the Beautiful,' a celebration of our homeland. Steves and the Pops then traveled to Austria, with the 'Emperor Waltz' by Johann Strauss Jr., the 'No. 1 hit from 1889.' Next, it was up the Danube River to Bavaria, Germany, with an example of King Ludwig's favorite composer, Richard Wagner. Russell took a very brisk tempo in the Prelude to Act III of 'Lohengrin,' and the brass and horn sections played it thrillingly.\nSmetana's 'The Moldau' was named for the longest river in the Czech Republic, the 'Vlatava,' and illustrates tone painting in music. Steves provided a road map to its picturesque landmarks, adding that the work embodies the enduring spirit of the Czech people, who have long struggled with 'big bully neighbors.' Finishing the first half, Elgar's Military March No. 1 from 'Pomp and Circumstance' was set in a new light when Steves told us it 'captures the grandeur of the world's first superpower under Queen Victoria.'\nAfter intermission, Russell led a fresh and invigorating performance of Felix Mendelssohn's 'Italian' Symphony, the German composer's postcard of Italy. The Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi 'stirred national spirits like a bugle call,' especially in his opera, 'Nabucco.' Russell and the Pops delivered a stirring rendition of its Overture, taking care to express the beauty of 'Va, pensiero,' the haunting chorus of Hebrew slaves at its center.\nThe tour bus next traveled to Spain via Russia for 'Alborada' by Rimsky Korsakov, followed by Manuel de Falla's 'Ritual Fire Dance.' The second half included an exuberant, brass-filled French military march by Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns, and an abridged arrangement of 'Ode to Joy' from Beethoven's Symphony No. 9. (Did you know that 'Ode to Joy' is the official anthem of the European Union?)\nSteves added a personal note to Grieg's 'Morning Mood' from 'Peer Gynt,' his tribute to Norway, 'the land of my grandparents.' He added a sweet story about meeting his Norwegian Uncle Thor for the first time.\nRick Steves addresses the audience as conductor John Morris Russell looks on. The Pops musicians sported new, updated red blazers created by Cincinnati company Sew Valley. JP Leong\nThe evening ended when Steves surprised viewers by picking up Russell's baton for a rousing performance of Sousa's 'Stars and Stripes Forever.' The orchestra was in top form all evening as they performed these wonderful tunes.\nSteves also was in top form, despite his announcement in August that he will undergo surgery in late September for prostate cancer. Steves, who lives in Washington, noted that he'd just been in Paris filming a gourmet barge trip through Burgundy, slated for a future PBS show.\n'Normally I fly directly from Paris to Seattle, but I'm tickled to stop in Cincinnati,' he said.\nAt intermission, he held a drawing for a free trip on one of his company's tours, won by a woman in Row F.\nKicking off the new season, the Pops musicians sported new, updated red blazers created by Cincinnati company Sew Valley. And if you looked down at your feet in the lobby, you'd have seen newly restored flooring that is historic to the building, thanks to the Friends of Music Hall.\nRick Steves' Europe: A Symphonic Journey repeats at 7:30 p.m. Sept. 14 and 2 p.m. Sept. 15 in Music Hall. Tickets: 513-381-3300, cincinnatisymphony.org/pops.\nJanelle Gelfand covers the arts for the Courier.

            "summary": "A record-breaking four Manitoba-produced features were given a place at the table at this year's Toronto International Film Festival, but only three are actually set in Winnipeg.\nRumours, a satire from Winnipeggers Guy Maddin, Evan Johnson and Galen Johnson, is set in Germany and was filmed in Hungary. Matthew Rankin's Universal Language is set in Winnipeg, but an alternate-universe version of the city, where Louis Riel is on the common currency and the official languages are French and Farsi.\nThat leaves two other visions of Winnipeg on display at TIFF, which opened on Sept. 5 and wraps up Sunday. Each film offers a bold and distinctive view of the city.\nThe Mother and the Bear, by Vancouver-based Chinese-Canadian filmmaker Johnny Ma, portrays a Winnipeg viewed through a beautiful fairy tale prism, through the story of a mother who comes to the city from Korea to check on her hospitalized daughter, rendered comatose after a spill on an icy sidewalk.\nAberdeen, by extreme contrast, is a gritty drama about the title character, a woman whose terrible choices come back to haunt her as she navigates bars, hotel rooms, government offices and drug dens in a desperate effort to prevent her grandchildren from entering foster care.\nThe Mother and the Bear represents an interesting melange: a magic-laced comedy fashioned by a Chinese-Canadian director with money from Canada and Chile, and featuring two Korean actors.\nTopping it off: director Ma is based in Vancouver (and sometimes Mexico), so it seems especially peculiar that he would call The Mother and the Bear \"a love letter to Winnipeg.\"\n\"The original story that I wrote, that was based on a real person that I met, was actually set in Cincinnati,\" Ma said during a small after-party following the film's TIFF screening. \"So when I started working with Chileans, they brought me to the Canadian partner.\n\"I thought that they were going to suggest Toronto, Calgary, Vancouver, and those cities, and I was thinking, 'That's not the story. It doesn't work there.'\"\nFortunately, one of the producers on the film was frequent Guy Maddin collaborator Niv Fichman.\n\"And Niv said Winnipeg,\" Ma recalled. \"I was about to fight him on it. But then I said, 'Wait, that is really interesting.'\n\"As a Canadian filmmaker, I've always been fascinated by Winnipeg filmmakers,\" Ma said. \"Their art is so different than anything else that you can ever see in Canada or the world.\"\nSo he decided to \"make it an adventure.\"\n\"I took this as an opportunity to learn about Winnipeg, and what I learned about it is that there is a kindness in the cold,\" Ma said.\nHe had good teachers. He spoke with Maddin (who has a brief cameo as a dog-walker).\n\"He is the godfather of the Winnipeg cinema for every one of us,\" Ma said. \"I wanted him to be in the film in spirit.\"\nMaddin's Rumours co-directors, the Johnson brothers, were also producers on the film.\nAnother filmmaker, Mike Maryniuk, \"was, to me, my Winnipeg whisperer,\" Ma said.\nWhile some of the visiting actors were startled by the cold of a winter shoot, Ma found it soothing.\n\"The winter is the time when you go within yourself in some weird way,\" Ma said. \"I lost my father two years ago during the pandemic, so [when] I went to Winnipeg, it nurtured me.\n\"It was the most creative I've ever felt in Canada,\" he said. \"So to me, the movie became a thank-you letter back to Winnipeg.\"\nAberdeen, a hard-hitting drama, offers a far different view of the city.\nIt follows a woman (Gail Maurice from Night Raiders) from Peguis First Nation in southern Manitoba literally fighting to reclaim her identity after losing her ID. Occasionally sheltered from the abuses of the system by her two-spirit friend Alfred (Billy Merasty), she struggles to reconnect with her dying brother (Ryan Rajendra Black) and her own drug-addicted daughter.\nThe story is a personal one for writer-director Ryan Cooper, who is himself from Peguis First Nation and a graduate of the National Screen Institute's CBC New Indigenous Voices program.\nHe got help to realize it from co-director Eva Thomas, a member of Walpole Island First Nation in southwestern Ontario, who worked on Aberdeen between series gigs on Manitoba-filmed shows Acting Good and Don't Even.\nThe decision to co-direct was Thomas's.\n\"Ryan sent me the script, and I read it, I loved it,\" Thomas said. \"And I sent him notes and he thought they were helpful.\"\nCooper asked Thomas if she would direct the film herself.\n\"She said, 'No, but I will direct it with you,'\" said Cooper.\nThomas said it was important to her that Cooper be involved as a director, \"because it's such a personal story to him.\"\nBoth have been to TIFF before \u2014 Thomas premiered her short film Redlights at the festival last year \u2014 but say they're thrilled to have their first feature at the festival.\n\"It's been wonderful. It's a dream come true,\" says Cooper. \"I always came as part of a delegation, but never as a director-writer.\"\nWhile it's a tough film, Thomas says audiences at the premiere screening were engaged.\n\"We got a standing ovation, which is really nice,\" Thomas said. \"And there were a lot of questions after the screening. People want to talk to you until they were pushed out. In the lobby, people were still coming up and talking to us.\"\nShe laughed as he recalled finding no refuge in the washroom.\n\"I was there for another 20 minutes,\" she said.\nThomas said encountering homeless people in Winnipeg galvanized her in the effort to get the film made.\n\"That's my driving force with Aberdeen. How do we create empathy and compassion for a person like Aberdeen?\" Thomas said.\n\"People can go on a journey with her, and even though she starts off difficult and unlikable and challenging, you can understand,\" Thomas said. \"Those aren't character flaws. She's a product of her trauma.\"\nCooper said it feels like the film is \"giving voice to the voiceless.\"\n\"They don't understand where this trauma comes from. I want to give a voice to that and create an image of what it's like to break a cycle,\" he said.\n\"That was really important to me. Because I broke a cycle.\"",

            "summary": "Ox Sahin sighs as he begins his first review of a kebab on TikTok.\n'I don't want to do this, I really don't. But I have to. I speak for the whole kebab industry when I say, if you take a shot at us, someone is going to clap back.'\nSahin is reviewing a new food truck in Sydney that's offering 'Berlin-style' kebabs, which he says differ significantly from a 'Sydney-style' kebab, and a trend the kebab-shop owner says should be resisted.\nHe's scathing in his review of the Berlin kebab, saying the 'bread's too thick' and that there is 'too much sauce'.\nThe review set off something of a firestorm in the kebab world, attracting nearly half a million views and more than 1,200 comments, and sparked a state-wide odyssey for Sahin. He has now committed to review every kebab shop in New South Wales, in an attempt to prove how far-reaching and consistent \u2013 not to mention delicious \u2013 the stores are.\nSign up for Guardian Australia's breaking news email\nHe estimates there are more than 2,000 kebab shops across the state, and by Thursday had reached 38 of them. At his current pace, he estimates he would need 6.5 years to reach them all.\n'I wanted to show people that we are a quiet giant in the hospitality industry, I wanted to show people that there are more kebab shops here than there are any other major chain,' Sahin tells Guardian Australia.\n'And I want to show how important we are to the food scene in this state.'\nSahin wants to prove that the Sydney-style of kebab is more than just a late-night gimmick or an oily mess \u2013 but a food staple across the state.\nHe's also opened the door to a conversation about the Australian-Turkish community's unique place among the many migrant communities in the country.\n'Our Sydney kebab, it's a classic, it's so simple. Doner meat is wrapped in Lebanese bread or Greek pita. And then you have lettuce, tomato, onion, sometimes tabouli, and sauces like barbecue, garlic or chilli,' explains Sahin.\n'A Berlin-style kebab usually comes in much thicker bread, almost like a burger,' he says. 'And they add things like pickled cabbage, they have a specific spicy sauce, it's just different.'\nBoth styles represent the journeys of their respective Turkish diasporas, an example of diverging styles and tastes, changed by the act of migration itself.\nThe doner kebab was brought to Australia by Turkish migrants, who began opening shops as early as the 1980s. And while there is little conclusive data, the community does claim to own a majority of kebab shops around the country.\nSahin says that the Sydney-style kebab is heavily influenced by other migrant communities in Australia, whether through the use of Lebanese bread and tabouli, or through condiments like barbecue sauce.\n'Our kebab here is a concoction of all these cultures coming together in Australia. And the kebab is 100% a multicultural cuisine, it takes from everyone around it.\n'This style of kebab is iconic, it's unique in the world, and is a trusted food in Australia. You can't get something like that in Turkey, or from other diasporas.'\nThe 'Berlin-style' kebab was developed in Germany in 1972, and is also an adaptation of a Turkish doner kebab, differing significantly again to what is offered in Turkey today \u2013 which usually includes less vegetables or sauce.\nTurkish immigrants to West Berlin in the 1970s popularised the sandwich, which has become a staple of Berlin's street-food culture.\nAnd just like in Australia, they took slices of the culture around them to formulate something unique to their new home.\nThe earliest known Turkish migrants arrived in Australia as part of the cameleers that serviced South Australia's pastoral industry between 1860 and 1900, with numbers picking up in the late 60s, growing to nearly 19,000 by 1974.\nAround this time, a man named Muammer T\u00fcys\u00fcz arrived in Australia with his family and only US$20 in his pocket.\nSign up to Afternoon Update\nOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters\nafter newsletter promotion\nT\u00fcys\u00fcz had worked in catering for the Turkish prime minister, and around 1974 attended a wedding in Australia that served doner kebabs. This got him thinking, and two years later, he imported his own machines and began operating a mobile kebab shop out the back of his station wagon.\nHis daughter, Melek T\u00fcys\u00fcz, says this made him the first person to sell kebabs in Australia.\n'He operated out of old Chinatown in Haymarket, in Sydney. It grew so popular, he then turned it into a truck that operated out of Flemington Markets weekly.'\nSoon after, T\u00fcys\u00fcz began operating at events like the Easter Show, where the sandwich exploded in popularity, and his business expanded rapidly.\n'I remember people just standing and watching the cooking process, and asking what it was, and how it worked? They would just stand and stare.'\nAdvertised at the time as a 'meal in a wrap', it began first as just meat, lettuce, tomato and onion, with no sauce. Melek said sauce was only added later.\nT\u00fcys\u00fcz won various awards for his food, winning 'best food outlet' at the Sydney Easter Show for four consecutive years in the early 1990s. He would go on to cater at major events such as the Sydney Olympics, AFL and NRL matches and music festivals.\nMelek pauses as she goes through old photos of her father standing proudly outside his food truck in the 1980s.\n'This generation of migrants, these people that came to this country with nothing in their pockets, they built the communities we have now,'' she says.\n'He had limited English, but he was never shy. He made this out of nothing, and changed the landscape of Australian cuisine, almost by himself. Maybe people don't remember, but I remember.'\nDr Lutfiye Ali, a lecturer in Community Psychology at Victoria University, says opening a kebab shop was often the easiest way for migrants with limited English \u2013 and whose skills weren't recognised in Australia \u2013 to make money.\nShe says the 'dream of a better life was shaped by racism in that economic opportunities and employment were limited for some migrants, so they capitalised on their skills to produce and to contribute to the social fabric around them'.\n'This is about migrants and their struggle for survival.'\nAli says the proliferation of kebab shops represented a search for safety, comfort and financial stability for the migrant generation who were establishing themselves for the benefits of the next generation.\nShe said the unique qualities of the Sydney-style kebab reflected this survival instinct, reshaping their traditions to the tastes of a new market.\n'They needed to make adjustments, but they've kept the essence of it.'\n'In many ways, these cultural expressions are a response to marginalisation. They are making the best of the difficult situations they found themselves in.'",

            "summary": "Workplace aggression is a well-known problem in health care, with doctors, nurses, and other medical staff frequently facing violence and verbal abuse from their patients.\nBut a specific form of abuse often flies under the radar: just how many health workers are subjected to sexual harassment, which can range from one-time comments in the hallways of a hospital to repeated altercations with a patient in the exam room.\nLooking at physicians alone, that share may be up to 45 per cent, according to a major study published recently in the Internal Medicine Journal.\nThe analysis of studies from seven countries \u2013 the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, the United States, Israel, Germany, and Malaysia \u2013 is the first large-scale review on the issue, and included a pooled 18,800 doctors from a range of specialties.\nIt reveals that even as public calls to curb violence against healthcare workers multiply, sexual harassment remains a pervasive problem in medicine \u2013 one with little recourse.\nSexual harassment 'is a unique occupational health hazard, and the reason for that is that people do have intimate contact with patients because they need to physically examine them,' Caroline Kamau-Mitchell, the study's lead author and an occupational health researcher at Birkbeck, University of London, told Euronews Health.\n'That conflation by some patients of the intimacy setting, where perhaps they have to undress or they have to discuss very intimate information about themselves, does unfortunately mean that health care workers are more at risk' than people in other professions.\nThe latest figures are far above the World Health Organization (WHO)'s 2019 estimate that 12.4 per cent of all health workers have been sexually harassed.\nKamau-Mitchell said that's because some types of health professionals have more contact with patients than others, which can make it misleading to combine groups, and because her analysis is more up-to-date, capturing a marked increase in harassment in recent years.\nDoctors working in emergency rooms or psychiatric units appear to be at higher risk of abuse because they are in high-stress settings and could have patients who don't know what they're doing, Kamau-Mitchell said.\nBut general practitioners are also subject to harassment because they see the same patients repeatedly over time, often with fewer people around compared with a hospital or emergency setting, according to Dr Tiago Villanueva, president of the European Union of General Practitioners/Family Physicians (UEMO).\n'We develop relationships with continuity with our patients,' Villanueva, who was not involved with the study, told Euronews Health. 'Some patients may abuse that trust'.\nThere's also a gender divide, with 52 per cent of women experiencing sexual harassment compared with 34 per cent of men, according to the analysis.\n'From the male patient to the female doctor, it's, quote, traditional sexism, or being against the idea of a female doctor,' Kamau-Mitchell said.\n'But from the female patient to the male doctor, it's a different type of sexism, of thinking that somehow males should tolerate this kind of behaviour, which is ridiculous'.\nWhile most countries don't report official statistics on sexual harassment of health care workers, some of the most comprehensive data comes from the UK. In a 2021 survey of about 1,800 UK doctors, 31.8 per cent said they had received unwanted, gender-related comments that caused 'embarrassment, distress, or offence' within the past two years.\nMeanwhile, between 2017 and 2022, National Health Service (NHS) workers reported nearly 21,000 cases of rape, sexual assault, harassment, stalking, and abusive comments by patients, though few units had processes in place to combat these problems, according to an investigation published last year.\nThose figures underscore that sexual harassment is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to aggression from patients. They also show that doctors aren't the only health workers at risk \u2013 nurses, trainees, and other staffers all face unwanted attention and threats.\nFor example, Umut Can \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, a medical student in Turkey and a leader in the European Medical Students' Association (EMSA), told Euronews Health that his female colleagues try to dress conservatively to avoid being leered at by patients.\nPaul de Raeve, a longtime nurse and secretary general of the European Federation of Nursing Associations, said he typically tried to get someone else in the room if he felt patients were making suggestive comments.\nHe said aggression toward nurses \u2013 including sexual harassment, physical and verbal attacks \u2013 has only escalated in recent years, with a profound effect on health workers' satisfaction at work.\n'COVID-19 has aggravated this situation,' de Raeve told Euronews Health. 'We are going to lose our nurses \u2026 because they said, 'enough is enough'''.\nThe issue also remains heavily stigmatised, and many health care workers don't report these incidents because they don't believe anything will be done to remedy the situation, de Raeve, Villanueva, and Kamau-Mitchell all said.\n'If you're a busy doctor and you're subject to this, and you're under such pressure that you don't even have time to report it or think much about it, you just trod on,' Villanueva said.\n'But that ultimately affects your mental health and makes you more prone to things like anxiety or depression'.\nWhile some countries, such as Spain and the Czech Republic, have national registries to monitor violence against healthcare workers, sexual harassment often falls into a grey area.\n'There's no day that we don't have a patient yelling or screaming or sometimes hitting health care professionals,' Villanueva said. 'But sexual harassment is something much more subtle'.\nMedical groups across Europe are pushing for a more comprehensive accounting of these incidents. They plan to circulate a standardised questionnaire among physicians, medical students, and other health workers that asks about physical and verbal abuse, including sexual harassment.\nRegardless of the data, Villanueva said that health systems should make it easier to expel people from a physician's patient list, so they don't have to see someone who has harassed them again.\nKamau-Mitchell wants hospitals to install panic alarms that allow staff to quickly call for help, and for doctors to be able to wear body cameras that record patient interactions \u2013 an option the UK's ambulance crews already have \u2013 though she acknowledges that patient privacy and data storage would be challenges.\nMedical students told Euronews Health that training on how to handle sexual harassment, including where to report it, is currently missing from school curricula. They'd like to see it prioritised more, but said their own instructors may first need to be trained.\n'Although we are told about how to recognise harassment or violence cases, we are not specifically told about how to act when we face violence as doctors in positions in hospitals or in clinics,' Duygu \u0130leri, a medical student in Turkey and EMSA's ethics and human rights lead, told Euronews Health.\nUltimately, the experts said it will likely take a combination of government, health system, and social changes to protect doctors and other medical personnel against sexual harassment and other forms of aggression.\nDoctors 'know these problems exist,' Kamau-Mitchell said, but 'unfortunately, they don't have the power to change these sorts of things'.\n'We need to realise that we can't just leave people to deal with problems on their own, because they, unfortunately, then become very psychologically burdened, and that isn't great for us as a society'.",

            "excerpt": "The US has often singled out Haitian immigrants. GOP attacks are the latest example.",
            "summary": "This past week, Republicans amplified a barrage of strange and racist claims about Haitian immigrants, including falsely suggesting that they're consuming people's house pets.\nThe unfounded attacks came from official party social media accounts, lawmakers, and from both members of the GOP's presidential ticket. Vice presidential candidate JD Vance said Monday that 'Haitian illegal immigrants' are 'causing chaos,' while former President Donald Trump emphatically, and falsely, claimed during his Tuesday debate with Vice President Kamala Harris that, 'they're eating the pets of the people that live there, and this is what's happening in our country.'\nThe comments echo well-worn tropes, and past attempts to tie Haitian immigrants to everything from the spread of illness to upticks in crime.\nRepublicans have elevated these messages as they seek to make immigration a flashpoint in the November election, capitalizing on voters' dissatisfaction with current trends. The attacks also come as rampant political instability and gang violence in Haiti has displaced thousands of people \u2014 and as the Biden administration has approved temporary protections and humanitarian parole for some new arrivals.\nThe stereotypes the GOP is harping on, however, have been around for much longer.\nIn fact, as experts tell Vox, these types of ugly attacks are the byproduct of centuries of anti-Black racism and xenophobic sentiment, which have been used over and over to justify restrictive immigration policies that single out Haitian people. The decision to resurface them in 2024 is, once again, creating a palpably dangerous environment, and adding to this legacy.\n'It's a part of a very old historic pattern,' Regine Jackson, a sociologist and the Dean of Humanities at Morehouse College, told Vox. 'It's the idea that they could do something so inhuman, so un-American. That's the message underneath, that these people will never be like us.'\nAttacks on Haitian immigrants tap into the longstanding US framing of Haiti as a threat.\n'Racism and xenophobia against Haitians among white Americans can be traced all the way back to the Haitian Revolution when Haitians \u2026 [overthrew] the system of slavery and [established] the world's first Black republic,' Carl Lindskoog, the author of a book on the US's detention of Haitian immigrants, told Vox. 'Since then, Haitians have been seen by many white Americans as a threat to white rule and have been treated as such.'\nIn 1804, Haitians successfully overthrew colonial rule and enslavement by France. Concerned that Haitians' victory would inspire enslaved people in America to pursue a similar revolution, the US did not recognize Haiti's independence for nearly six decades.\nFollowing the revolution, France used military force to demand financial restitution for loss of the colony, forcing Haiti to borrow money to cover its demands. The US and France provided those loans \u2014 and used them to continue exerting control over Haiti's finances for years. In total, a New York Times investigation found that reparations to France cost Haiti's economy $21 billion and directly contributed to poverty and financial problems that still plague the country to this day.\nThe US also occupied Haiti by force from 1915 to 1934, more than a century after its successful revolution, under the flimsy justification that it was there to ensure political stability following the assassination of multiple Haitian presidents. In reality, it mounted the occupation to prevent France or Germany from gaining ground in the region, which was viewed as strategically valuable. During this time, the US set up a system of forced labor, and sold Haitian land to American corporations.\nThe takeover also sent a demeaning message: that Haiti wasn't capable of handling its own affairs.\n'A lot of scholars have talked about \u2026 rhetoric that's used to justify invasion around civilizing a society,' says Jamella Gow, a sociologist at Bowdoin University. 'This notion of Haitians as backwards, criminal and dangerous started way back then.' The association of Haiti with voodoo practices, something self-help author Marianne Williamson, who ran in the Democratic presidential primary in 2020 and 2024, evoked this week, is another tactic that's been used to suggest that they're a 'mysterious \u2026 migrant other,' says Gow.\nIn the decades since, the US's treatment of Haitian immigrants has built on and reinforced these ideas. That was evident in the 1970s, when a wave of Haitian migrants sought asylum in the US as they tried to escape political persecution from US-backed dictator Jean Claude Duvalier. Many of these arrivals were detained and denied asylum, though they met the qualifications for it.\nThese practices set a precedent for the detention of asylum-seekers, a punitive approach the US still employs now. In a 1980 Haitian Refugee Center v. Civiletti case, the Fifth Circuit ruled that the US government had singled Haitians out and practiced blatant racism in its immigration policies. Despite this decision, then-President Jimmy Carter and his successors managed to find loopholes to keep up this approach. In the years that followed, while a surge of Cuban and Haitian migrants came to the US around the same time, Haitian people were far more likely to stay in detention compared to their Cuban counterparts.\nThe stigmatization of Haitian immigrants continued, too, in subsequent decades, including efforts to associate Haitians with illnesses, such as HIV. In the early 1980s, when no scientific name had been given to HIV/AIDS, the press and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention deemed it the 4H disease \u2014 which stood for 'Haitians, Homosexuals, Hemophiliacs, and Heroin users,' in part because some of the early cases of the illness included Haitian people.\nA fear of HIV \u2014 and the framing of Haitian immigrants as carriers of disease \u2014 was among the reasons that led the US to detain Haitian asylum seekers at Guantanamo Bay during the 1990s. (Thousands were detained and deported, while some who were HIV-positive were threatened with indefinite detention.) That's part of a long history of the US government deeming immigrants health hazards in order to stymie their entry into the country \u2014 a practice that was again embraced during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nBoth the Trump and Biden administrations used a federal authority known as Title 42 to turn away migrants due to public health concerns during and following pandemic. Haitians were one of the largest groups turned away at the southern border on these grounds, Lindsvoog said.\nOther attacks on Haitians were also evident in both administrations, such as when Trump himself referred to Haiti as a 'shithole' country, and when border patrol officers were captured riding on horses and using their reins to confront Haitian immigrants under Biden.\nIn the town of Springfield, Ohio, the latest GOP invective is already doing real-world harm.\nOn Tuesday, Trump gave the conspiracy its largest platform yet, and since then, the claims about the immigrants, which have been repeatedly debunked, have only spread.\nIn the wake of all this, Haitian immigrants in Springfield \u2014 the town in which the GOP claims the pet eating is taking place \u2014 have experienced property damage and are keeping their children home from school out of concerns for safety, the Haitian Times reports.\nSpringfield's city hall was also evacuated on Thursday in response to a bomb threat, and two elementary schools were evacuated on Friday due to concerns about public safety. The municipality's mayor has said he believes both incidents are tied to the claims that have been made about Haitian migrants.\nSpringfield, a town of roughly 60,000 people in the southwestern part of the state, has found itself in Republican crosshairs due to the changes it's seen since 2020. About 15,000 Haitian people have moved to Springfield for jobs following a manufacturing boom there, and while the growth in population has helped rejuvenate the town, it's also put pressure on social services in the form of longer wait times at medical clinics and more competition for affordable housing, fueling some animosity toward the newcomers.\nThat anger only intensified in 2023, following a school bus accident that killed 11-year-old Aiden Clark, since the driver of the car involved was a Haitian immigrant. Republicans and right-wing figures have since invoked Clark's death to highlight the threat immigrants pose \u2014 something his parents have begged them to stop doing.\nThis hostility toward Haitian immigrants has resulted in neo-Nazis and Republican lawmakers spreading lies about immigrants eating not just pets, but also ducks from the local parks. There is no evidence of this, Springfield officials have said. One instance of a woman \u2014 neither an immigrant nor of Haitian descent \u2014 eating a cat took place in Canton, Ohio, which is many miles away.\nTropes about people eating pets aren't new, and have long been used to demonize immigrant communities in the US, including Asian immigrants. Such stereotypes allow Republicans to paint immigrants, including Haitian people, as 'forever foreigners' in a bid to ostracize them. The focus on pets, in particular, is designed to undercut immigrants' humanity, and to suggest that they could harm something people hold dear, says Jackson.\n'This kind of language, this kind of disinformation, is dangerous because there will be people that believe it, no matter how ludicrous and stupid it is, and they might act on that kind of information and act on it in a way where somebody could get hurt. So it needs to stop,' White House spokesperson John Kirby said at a press briefing Tuesday.\nVance downplayed these concerns after Tuesday's presidential debate when he was asked about his comments by NBC's Yamiche Alcindor. 'What do I think is a bigger problem? Insulting 20,000 people or the fact that my constituents can't live a good life because Kamala Harris opened the border?' Vance said.\nAs US history \u2014 and the threats Springfield faced this week \u2014 makes clear, however, these racist ideas can have a direct influence on policies, and lead to immediate, and dire, consequences.\nYou've read 1 article in the last month\nHere at Vox, we believe in helping everyone understand our complicated world, so that we can all help to shape it.

            "excerpt": "The north London derby rarely disappoints and there is plenty at stake, even this early in the season",
            "summary": "Games between Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal rarely disappoint.\nThere has not been a goalless draw in the north London derby for 15 years and last season's two matches produced nine goals.\nArsenal have won on their past two trips to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and, already \u2014 slightly ridiculously, given we are three games into the season \u2014 there is a sense they need another one to stay in touch with a Manchester City team who have won their past 14 consecutive Premier League matches.\nWith plenty at stake for both teams, The Athletic 's Tottenham reporter Jay Harris, Arsenal writer Jordan Campbell and senior data analyst Mark Carey consider the key talking points going into Sunday's match. Is this a good time for Tottenham to face Arsenal?\nHarris: Spurs will be smelling blood when they look at the number of key players unavailable to Mikel Arteta. Ange Postecoglou has also been dealing with injury issues, but if Dominic Solanke and Micky van de Ven are fully fit, he can field his strongest XI.\nWhen these two sides faced each other in April, Ben Davies \u2014 deputising for the injured Destiny Udogie \u2014 could not keep up with Bukayo Saka. Udogie is fit again after spending the summer recovering from thigh surgery and his battle with Saka should be more even. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg scored an own goal in that game but has since left for Marseille and Postecoglou has a wider variety of options in central midfield.\nThe biggest concern for Tottenham is that they can still look vulnerable at the back. Cristian Romero has made a couple of costly errors, which is somewhat understandable when you consider he only spent a couple of weeks on holiday after winning the Copa America with Argentina before returning for pre-season. Romero could have done with a rest during the international break but he played twice for Argentina. Tottenham fans will be hoping the extra game time has boosted his sharpness and that it does not leave him feeling knackered.\nCarey: It is a cliche but it's true \u2014 all rules go out of the window in derby games. The quick turnaround after the international break might mean that the contest is a little lower in intensity, but this one is difficult to predict.\nFor Arsenal, it is not just the blow of \u2014 as seems very likely \u2014 losing Martin Odegaard's quality to injury but also how much it affects them tactically. Arsenal's captain is a key component of their right-sided rotations with Ben White and Saka \u2014 a trio who have been so consistent for the past 18 months. They have plenty of quality elsewhere across the pitch, but add in Declan Rice's suspension and Arsenal fans' concerns become understandable.\nSpurs have not made the blistering start of last season but have played well. On another day, they would have comfortably dispatched Leicester City and Newcastle United with the chances they generated and we all know that the football xG gods have a way of balancing things out across a season.\nMight we see Spurs create fewer chances but score two scruffy goals? You wouldn't bet against it.\nGO DEEPER\nThree games in is too early to trust the Premier League table... or is it?\nCampbell: Considering Arsenal's missing players, yes, they are weaker, but that need to capitalise brings its own pressure for Spurs.\nArteta signing a new three-year contract, however, should re-energise Arsenal and balance out any pessimism.\nIt is a statement of intent that says Arsenal are not content with being challengers. They want more and a win at Spurs would be the perfect way to show they are not going anywhere. Want all the latest Arsenal news, analysis and additional insight from James McNicholas, Amy Lawrence, David Ornstein, Art de Roche, Jordan Campbell and more? Join our new Arsenal WhatsApp channel Are we in for another exciting derby?\nHarris: This fixture always produces drama. Postecoglou's philosophy is all about dominating the ball and pressuring the other team high up the pitch. When it works, as in their 4-0 victory over Everton last month, Tottenham do not let their opponents breathe and they score goals for fun.\nThe style of play comes with a lot of risk. Spurs push so many players forward that they leave themselves vulnerable to counter-attacks. Saka's goal in Arsenal's 3-2 victory at the end of last season is a prime example of this. As can be seen below, Spurs dominated possession and territory but Arsenal took their chances.\nHarry Kane is no longer at Spurs but Son Heung-min remains a threat. The speed of Brennan Johnson and Wilson Odobert will cause problems for Arsenal's full-backs, too. Solanke will make his home debut if he recovers from an ankle injury and scoring would be the perfect way to mark it.\nCampbell: Arsenal were relentlessly efficient in the 3-2 win last season, making the most of their dominance from dead-ball situations.\nBut in last season's first meeting, the enduring issue of playing well but spurning big chances prevented them from killing off the game early. Gabriel Jesus was most guilty and with the Brazilian potentially filling in for Kai Havertz up front, the question of whether Arsenal have enough killer instinct hangs over them.\nTransitions will be key again for both teams and a first start for Raheem Sterling could help Arsenal add that extra incisiveness. Goals seem inevitable but do not be surprised to see Arteta employ a slightly more restrained, counter-attacking approach to compensate for the absence of Rice and Odegaard. How might Arsenal's midfield injuries affect things?\nCampbell: Arsenal will probably be without what Arteta intended to be his first-choice midfield this season, with Mikel Merino and Odegaard both injured and Rice suspended.\nThe sale of Emile Smith Rowe and the loan exit of Fabio Vieira means Arsenal cannot replicate the balance they would usually have.\nHavertz dropping into midfield, with Jesus taking his place up front, is a natural solution to the left-sided central-midfielder gap, but Jorginho and Thomas Partey are the only other senior conventional midfielders available. Partey being pushed forward slightly to allow the Italian to play at No 6 is one option, as is tweaking the shape to employ a double pivot, but both players can leave Arsenal lacking mobility and creativity.\nDropping Leandro Trossard back to play alongside Havertz would be an aggressive move but would risk leaving Arsenal too open. Shifting either Oleksandr Zinchenko or Jurrien Timber forward into midfield could help Arteta maximise continuity in their build-up play.\nThe closest thing to a like-for-like Odegaard replacement is 17-year-old Ethan Nwaneri. It would be his first senior start but he could help Arsenal maintain their balance. Using an inexperienced teenager would also be the strongest rebuttal Arteta could serve to those sceptical of his willingness to trust academy players.\nGO DEEPER\nHow do Arsenal adapt if they are missing Odegaard and other first-choice midfielders?\nHarris: James Maddison is the only midfielder to have started all of Tottenham's games this season. The 27-year-old has been accompanied by a rotating cast of Rodrigo Bentancur, Yves Bissouma, Pape Matar Sarr or Dejan Kulusevski, depending on the quality of the opposition.\nIn the second half of their 2-1 defeat by Newcastle, Spurs seemed to strike the right balance with a combination of Bissouma, Maddison and Kulusevski. The former protected the back four, Maddison dropped into pockets of space and sprayed passes across the pitch while Kulusevski drove forward with the ball into threatening positions. It would be a bold call by Postecoglou to start this trio against Arsenal but it might be exactly what is required to take advantage of Rice, Merino and Odegaard's absences. If Postecoglou wants to be a little more cautious, expect to see Sarr slot in alongside Maddison and Bissouma.\nCarey: There were only three games in which Odegaard did not start in the Premier League last season. Two of those were against relegated teams \u2014 Burnley and Sheffield United \u2014 making Arsenal's match at Newcastle a decent example of how they set up in the Norwegian's absence.\nLooking at their passing network (below), it is encouraging to see that those right-sided triangles remained and Saka was not dragged deeper. On that day, Havertz was tasked with playing in the right-sided central-midfield role but, this weekend, he is more likely to play to the left or up front.\nHaving Zinchenko or Timber as ball-playing inside full-backs will add strength to the midfield, so you would expect to see greater numbers in central areas compared with the above graphic, where Jorginho was tasked with locking things down almost single-handedly.\nWhoever plays, expect to see the same principles of play with Arsenal and a focus on wide rotations to stretch Spurs' back line. Would a win be more significant for Postecoglou or Arteta?\nHarris: Postecoglou's second season in charge of Tottenham has started underwhelmingly. They dominated for large spells against Leicester and Newcastle but failed to win. They tore Everton apart and demonstrated how devastating they can be when everything clicks, but Arsenal will be their toughest test yet.\nTottenham have lost to Arsenal at home for two successive seasons. They only earned one point against them last year and the last time they beat Arsenal was in May 2022 when Antonio Conte was still in charge. If Postecoglou can guide them to victory on Sunday, it would kick their season into gear and be a huge statement of intent.\nIf Spurs lose, they will have only taken four points out of a possible 12 and the arguments about Postecoglou's entertaining but divisive style of play will become much louder.\nCampbell: This was always going to be the start of a huge week, with a north London derby, a Champions League opener and a visit to Manchester City crammed into eight days.\nBut the 1-1 draw with Brighton & Hove Albion means the pressure on beating Spurs is already ramping up.\nArteta and his Arsenal players can lean on recent triumphs. They have become a team that thrives in big matches. After beating Spurs in May 2022, they went on a 17-game unbeaten streak in London derbies. Against the so-called 'Big Six' last season, they took 22 points from 30, becoming only the fourth team to go unbeaten against their rivals in a single season.\nA win would not be as significant to Arteta as he has re-established the upper hand in the fixture over the past two seasons but in the context of chasing City, this already feels like a must-win. What are the key tactical battles?\nHarris: Watching Udogie take on Saka will be exciting and Solanke has the difficult task of escaping William Saliba's clutches.\nThe key match-up, however, could be Bissouma against Havertz. The Germany international is expected to drop into midfield and, if fit, Bissouma will have the responsibility of tracking his dangerous runs into the box. Bissouma has produced two solid performances after missing the opening game of the season through suspension but can he step up against elite opposition? If Bissouma is not fit enough to play, that task could fall to Bentancur. The Uruguayan is available to start, three days after being charged by the FA over comments he made about team-mate Son.\nKeep an eye on Maddison and whoever is tasked with marking him, too. Jorginho and Partey are far less mobile than Rice and Merino, which means Maddison might get that crucial extra second he needs to play a killer pass.\nCampbell: It was the pressing of both teams that dominated the first fixture last season and the set-piece superiority of Arsenal that proved decisive in the second game.\nBoth of those aspects could prove key again, especially if Arsenal field a less dynamic midfield three. Jorginho was caught dithering on the ball in the 2-2 draw as both teams aggressively pressed the first line of build-up (as can be seen from their above-average 'high press' scores in The Athletic 's match dashboard below).\nPostecoglou will hope his team are better equipped to deal with that challenge, having had a year to get used to his methods. When Pedro Porro and Udogie drift into the centre, Arsenal's midfield will need to ensure there is no space for Maddison and Bissouma to dictate play.\nCarey: One of Arsenal's key strengths last season was their suffocating, relentless high press.\nTheir title challenge was built on rock-solid defensive foundations, and that was not exclusively because of their classy centre-backs \u2014 it was from their co-ordinated attackers not letting the opposition play out comfortably.\nBy contrast, one of Spurs' biggest issues last year was their tendency to give the ball away in their own defensive third. No side had more build-ups that led to an opposition transition than Spurs' 14.9 per 90 minutes in 2023-24, with undoubted room for Postecoglou's side to improve over the summer.\nSure, we are in a new season now but it is worth keeping an eye out for this part of the game when Spurs have the ball in their own third. If both sides show similar character traits from last season, there could be a key tactical battle at one particular end of the field.

            "summary": "During the 1992 European Championship in Sweden, UEFA was given the first glimpse of the future. The Champions League, a bold rebrand of the prestigious European Cup, was months away from its launch and the governing body's executive team were gathered to picture how their new flagship competition might look.\n'I'll never forget taking those brand sketches to Lennart Johansson (UEFA president) and Gerhard Aigner (chief executive),' Craig Thompson, the former managing director at TEAM Marketing, tells The Athletic .\n'We sat looking at the designs and then at each other. Everyone said immediately: 'That's it'. You never have that when creating a brand because everyone's got an opinion. But everyone was in agreement. The stars represented the best players and teams in Europe, all coming together for football.'\nThe star ball logo, created by London-based designer Phil Clements, was to form the central pillar of the Champions League brand and, 32 years later, remains largely untouched. Instantly recognisable, it has become synonymous with the most coveted competition in club football, one that has helped drive UEFA's annual revenues above \u20ac4.3billion (\u00a33.63bn; $4.76bn).\nThe Champions League is changing this season, introducing a 36-team league phase, but the strength of its brand has never been more obvious. It has become the competition the elite clubs covet, effectively projecting prestige and aspiration.\nIt is not for everyone, as those who devised a breakaway European Super League (ESL) might attest, but the climbing TV deals and commercial income illustrate a global appeal that UEFA could not have envisaged at its inception.\nThere is enormous power in the brand, bringing money to the kitty \u2014 buckets of it. Clubs competing in this season's expanded competition are forecast to share a prize pot totalling \u00a32.08billion, a 22 per cent rise on last season.\nPerhaps only the Premier League can rival the Champions League's growth, but even they struggle to compete on image. The omnipresent star ball, the classical lettering font, the anthem heard a thousand times. The last three decades have seen it all added to football's lexicon.\n'They've created a brand where we're seeing the best of the best,' says Hugo Hensley, head of sports services at Brand Finance, a leading brand valuation and strategy consultancy. 'It gets all the attention and that brings desirability where the clubs are all obsessed with winning it and that brings more broadcasting, sponsorship, money. That means it keeps becoming this bigger event, bubbling up and up.'\nGO DEEPER\nHow the Champions League was created - told by those who did it\nNothing illustrates the exponential success of the Champions League brand like the numbers.\nIn the inaugural 1992-93 competition, the total prize pot was 38million Swiss Francs (roughly \u00a334m at current rates), with eventual runners-up AC Milan taking the biggest chunk at 7.5million Swiss Francs (\u00a36.7m). Given this season's winners could walk away with \u00a3136m, it is a 20-fold rise in 32 years. Season Club Earnings\nThe last two decades, in particular, have seen the value of the Champions League spiral. Commercial rights revenue has climbed from \u00a3114m a season in 2004-05 to \u00a3507m in 2022-23. Broadcast revenues, meanwhile, have rocketed from \u00a3410m to \u00a33bn in the same period.\nAnd they will only increase when UEFA next shares its figures. A new three-year TV cycle will see TNT Sports and Amazon Prime combine to hand over \u00a31.4bn for the UK TV rights, while the American rights, considered a boom market for European football, will be worth $250m (\u00a3190m) a season over the next six years, up on the previous $100m a season.\nBroadcasting deals essentially amount to a measure of popularity and the Champions League's lustre has them queuing up in all markets.\n'While the World Cup is still the biggest event globally in terms of viewership, the club game has far outgrown the international game in terms of engagement and commercial power,' says Dan Haddad, head of commercial strategy at Octagon, a sports, music and entertainment agency.\n'The Champions League now has a unique place in the football calendar. It's the one property where all the elite clubs are competing.\n'The evidence of its success is that nothing else has come along to challenge it or replace it. The whole concept of it was what led to the Super League discussion. The owners of these clubs thought a version of it, where elite European clubs regularly compete with each other, was the way to go.'\nUEFA cut off that threat at the pass. Twelve of Europe's biggest clubs signed up to the ESL in April 2021, believing there was greater control and financial rewards to be found in a breakaway competition.\nThat revealed a level of vulnerability for UEFA, with Real Madrid and Barcelona still agitators from within, but the Champions League has retained its position at the top of the mountain for now after grand plans crashed and burned inside 72 chaotic hours.\nFIFA has plenty of ground to make up with its rival competition, the Club World Cup, which launched its own slick branding this month. That will only be held every four years and does not offer the same assurances over the teams competing. Liverpool, Barcelona and Manchester United, for example, will not play in a Club World Cup until 2029 at the earliest.\n'FIFA are trying a bit of a land grab with the Club World Cup,' Haddad says. 'They've realised that without having an anchor property within the elite club game, your commercial growth is going to be limited.'\nIndependent data collected by Brand Finance indicates the Champions League is the most followed club competition in the world and is also the one most commonly associated with having world-class teams, scoring higher than the World Cup, Premier League, Formula 1 and NFL.\nThe Champions League might have needed to repurpose the European Cup's storied history in its early years, but now it has built its own back catalogue \u2014 think Zinedine Zidane's volley at Hampden Park in 2002, Manchester United's Camp Nou comeback three years earlier and all those glories of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. It has become the trophy to mould the legacies of greats.\nZinedine Zidane's exquisite volley handed Real Madrid #UCL glory for the ninth time, #OTD in 2002.\nWhat a way to decide a Champions League final.\n\ud83c\udfac @btsportfootball pic.twitter.com/4ht0nkAGAV\n\u2014 The Athletic | Football (@TheAthleticFC) May 15, 2023\n'Within football, the only thing more followed is the World Cup,' says Hensley. 'That's not just Europe, we research the United States, Brazil, China, India and Australia. It's 83 per cent of football fans are following it, which is pretty amazing. The World Cup is at 92 per cent, which is exceptional.\n'The only real one next is the Premier League. You've got things like a World Cup, the Olympics, even something like Wimbledon. They aren't great comparisons because they're one-off events and don't get the same level of engagement.\n'Heritage and prestige are massively attractive to sponsors. It's seen as genuine and authentic, long-lasting. They're the attributes you want to associate with. It'll be very difficult for something like the Club World Cup to create a distinct product without it looking like it's copying. Only the Premier League has created this brand that runs through.'\nUEFA's leap of faith in the early 1990s offered no guarantees. Not everyone was convinced by the case for reform, but there was always potential. How could there not be? The best of every European domestic league competing on midweek nights to crown an eventual king of the continent.\nYet it needed a brand to reflect the sea change. TEAM, which remains UEFA's marketing partner, was tasked with delivering a commercial programme to UEFA in 1992.\n'We wanted to it represent the best of the best of European football and the players being the gods of the game,' explains Thompson, formerly of TEAM and now overseeing his own sports consultancy.\n'We really wanted to elevate the image of football to this almost celestial sport. Our first opening sequence was done by an agency in London and they did this gods of Greece thing, with players cast in marble. These guys came out of the marble and onto the pitch. It was very cool.'\nThe brand became a thread that ran through all planning. The star ball would be everywhere \u2014 on ball boys' bibs, a centre circle flag, the sleeves of shirts, even a centrally positioned advertising board on halfway usually reserved for the highest paying sponsor.\n'The Champions League was a product,' adds Thompson, who would help TEAM and UEFA take over stadiums before games to ensure consistency across the competition throughout its first decade. 'And it was packaged like a consumer product. It was very different thinking to what existed in those days when FIFA would maybe put up a sign somewhere outside a stadium.\n'Believe me, we went down to every last detail. When we went to the matches, all the staff wore uniforms. A blazer with the Champions League patch on the chest. We had Champions League cuff links, ties \u2014 a Champions League belt buckle.\n'One of my colleagues was an English guy and when he saw the uniforms he was like, 'I'm never wearing that, I'll look like a clown'. I can tell you he ended up looking a clown like the rest of us.\n'A big part of the branding was also the music. I gave the same brief to a music company in London and they found Tony Britten (a British music director and composer). We wanted classical music and it was captured so perfectly. Today it's known by everyone in the world.'\nUEFA has approved subtle redesigns of the Champions League brand and re-recordings of its anthem, including for this season's competition, but both have been largely untouched by time. In truth, there is little need to change.\nThere were, though, early challenges.\n'When the Champions League first started you had the French calling it La Ligue des Champions and the Spanish were calling it La Liga de Campeones,' explains Thompson. 'I was on the phone to major papers and radio stations in France and Spain telling them they couldn't say that. It had to be the Champions League.\n'I'd get, 'You f****** American, we're French, don't tell us to say it in English'. But it was a legal issue, the name of the competition was the Champions League. It went on for three or four years. Nobody would ever believe the efforts we went to promoting that brand. It was in our DNA that the brand was sacred.'\nThere is no question that UEFA became a commercial pioneer in European sport when launching the Champions League. The Premier League, a behemoth in its own right, has followed many of the Champions League's leads, introducing an anthem before the 2020-21 season and crafting a more consistent visual identity at stadiums, including the match-ball plinth and a branding board that stands behind pre-match handshakes.\n'With the Champions League, there is the whole consistent visual identity, the sonic identity,' says Haddad. 'Everything about it is unique and premium. If you look at how the Premier League brand has evolved, one of the key reasons they moved away from Barclays as a sole partner was because they didn't have the same visual identity as UEFA and the Champions League.\n'The Champions League always followed more of an NFL/NBA style approach to building the brand, not having one big commercial partner across it to dictate how your IP has to show. The Premier League definitely took inspiration from the Champions League and how it's positioned globally very consistently.'\nUEFA's approach to commercial partnerships also helps tell the story of the Champions League's financial successes. The most recent set of accounting figures published by UEFA said commercial revenues alone had climbed to \u00a3507million in 2022-23, which is almost the same as Manchester United and Liverpool combined.\n'Commercially, it was an enormous leap forward (when the Champions League was launched) because it took the American sponsorship model and blended it with European football,' explains sports marketing expert Tim Crow. 'In America, today as then, if you talk to marketers about sponsorship, the first thing they'll talk about is the media buy. That's critical. A sponsorship deal has to include a substantial media presence as part of it. TV ads, basically.\n'What UEFA did was to take that model on. When you watched the Champions League on TV, the sponsors were bundled into the broadcast before the game, at half-time, after the game.\n'That not only helped establish the Champions League, it meant it was almost like watching Champions League TV. It made it much easier for sponsors to justify and pay for their involvement. That's ultimately why, commercially, it grew so fast.'\nThompson helped to build that. 'We were committed to less is more,' he says. 'In those early days, the late 1980s, early '90s, you'd have two or even three rows of advertising in stadiums with a hundred different brands.\n'No one could ever remember any of them. We decided we'd never have more than eight sponsors for the Champions League and at one point, we reduced that to four. Every broadcaster in Europe couldn't have the rights unless we had the programme sponsorship. At the beginning of every broadcast, it would say, 'This programme is brought to you by Ford and Mastercard', with their logos. That was very valuable.'\nUEFA has attached itself to long-standing, blue-chip commercial partners. Heineken, Playstation and Mastercard remain among the list of global sponsors of the Champions League capped at seven, also including Lay's, FedEx, crypto.com and Just Eat. Those will pay UEFA anything from between \u20ac50million and \u20ac100m per season for advertising packages set out in three-year cycles.\nUEFA can be open for more, too. Bet365 became the first sports betting brand to attach itself to the Champions League this summer. Gambling firms come with their own controversy, but the deal further bumped up revenues carved up predominately through the competing clubs.\nIt all starts again for another season on Tuesday night, with games staged in Italy, Germany, Spain, Portugal and Switzerland. To its dissenters, it remains in danger of becoming a closed shop for the elite, a 'super-league' in all but name.\nBut the strength of its brand, for now, only keeps growing.\n(Top photo: Getty Images; design: Dan Goldfarb)",
