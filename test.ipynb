The legislation is being introduced by the government on Tuesday, more than eight years after a ban was first proposed.\\nThe law is designed to boost the earnings of about 2 million waiting staff and other hospitality workers, and follows a series of expos\\u00e9s, many in the Guardian and the Observer, about companies deducting money intended for waiting and kitchen staff from customers' card payments.\\nInstead of passing on the service charge, chains including the luxury Ivy Collection have chosen to bump up workers' hourly pay rate by a set amount, no matter how much is collected during their working hours.\\nMany businesses have already adjusted their tips policy in the face of pressure from customers to ensure the service charge goes to the workers. However, some are still using the optional payment from clients to boost their profits, and one London chain, Ping Pong, introduced a 'brand' fee instead of a service charge before the new rules came in.\\nWith some hospitality businesses automatically adding as much as 15% in service charge \\u2013 leaving it to customers to opt out \\u2013 there can be substantial sums at stake. A 2022 survey by industry body UK Hospitality found that up to a fifth of businesses were keeping a share of the service charge to help cover their costs.\\nKate Nicholls, the chief executive of UK Hospitality, says businesses have 'been gradually getting ready for this' and moving towards a code of best practice endorsed by unions.\\nHowever, many restaurants struggling with the higher minimum wage and persistent food inflation will have little choice but to recoup costs related to the new legislation by increasing menu prices, reducing portion sizes or cutting costs elsewhere.\\n'Those that have been using the service charge to pay staff or to partly offset their wage bill are still going to have to pay their staff, but now won't be able to draw on this cash fund,' says Saxon Moseley, head of leisure and hospitality at consultancy RSM. 'And in that scenario, margins will be hit, in some cases fairly drastically.'\\nMeanwhile lawyers say some businesses are struggling to agree the terms of a 'fair' share of tips. Michael Powner, employment partner at Charles Russell Speechlys, says reaching a deal is often a difficult process: 'Employers need to ensure that what is agreed is 'fair' and that there is rational reasoning in place, while avoiding any potentially discriminatory rules.' Difficult areas, he says, could include whether the tips should be shared with those on maternity or sickness absence and, if so, for how long.\\nBryan Simpson, who organises hospitality staff for the Unite union, said he was concerned about businesses imposing unelected individuals and senior managers as heads of tip-pooling committees. He said some chain were 'deliberately misinterpreting the new fair tips legislation to suit business needs rather than the workers'.\\n'We will be doing everything in our power industrially, politically and legally to ensure that any unfair tipping policy is challenged,' he said.\\nSome workers already fear they may unexpectedly lose out as a result of the new rules, rather than gaining new rights to optional payments from clients.\\nAt Pizza Express, which has faced particular scrutiny over its approach to the distribution of tips, waiters will now have to share their cut of the service charge with salaried managers and shift managers after the chain deemed that the senior staff were legally bound to be included because they occasionally needed to step in and wait on tables.\\nThe restaurant does not levy a service charge unless a table is made up of seven people or more. It uses a 'tronc' pooling system to share out the service charge and voluntary tips to staff. The precise sharing of tips is voted on by a staff committee led by a 'troncmaster'.\\nIn order to fund that change, the group has reduced waiters' share of the tips to 68% from 70% and that will now also be shared with managers who wait tables. Non-waiters \\u2013 largely kitchen staff \\u2013 will share the remaining 32%.\\nIt is understood that the company plans to review the policy in January and every three months after that.\\nThe owner of the Ivy has previously said: 'All cash or credit card tips are kept directly by the member or members of the team who received the tip.'\",\"rights\":\"theguardian.com\",\"rank\":75,\"topic\":\"business\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Sarah Butler,Shane Hickey\",\"media\":\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad23eb25ee98508115272038129d7aff109d66ab/0_374_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ac757b064b604c6b08b10b66cca8f6b8\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":\"@guardian\",\"_score\":null,\"_id\":\"4484dfa55779485df4080ec4b5bbbe03\"},{\"title\":\"Your Friend Has More Money Than You Do.

Here's how two friends navigated a growing wealth gap.\",\"summary\":\"Adult friendships aren't easy to maintain. Busy schedules and competing demands interfere with making time for friends. And when money is involved, friendships can become even more complicated.\\nSimple activities, like going out to dinner or getting drinks, can quickly turn awkward. Bigger decisions, such as sharing an apartment or taking a joint vacation, are even more fraught, especially when one friend has deeper pockets than the other.\\n'Money brings up a lot,' said Aja Evans, a financial therapist and the author of 'Feel-Good Finance.' 'It brings up a fear of being misunderstood, rejected and judged.'\\nFinancial disparities in friendships can create an unease where one shouldn't exist, especially when people conflate their net worth with their self-worth.\\n'That's why it's so uncomfortable,' said Anna Goldfarb, the author of 'Modern Friendship: How to Nurture Our Most Valued Connections.' 'You might be OK with your parents paying for something, but a friend paying for you can feel strange because the power dynamic will feel off.'\\nThe relationship between power and money can also highlight broader social issues and disparities. 'It can call attention to differences in privilege and issues with bias and discrimination,' said Ms. Evans, 'and this may strain the friendship further.'\\nHowever, not all financially disparate friendships are doomed. Natalie Vallot, 49, and Hilah Johnson, 44, have been friends for over two decades. In 2010, Ms. Johnson started a YouTube cooking show, 'Hilah Cooking.' When the show took off, so did her income. As Ms. Vallot struggled financially to get through nursing school, the two had to navigate a growing wealth gap. Here's how they did it.\\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\\nWhat were your finances like when you met?\\nMs. Johnson: Natalie, I feel like you were the rich one when we first met.\\nMs. Vallot: I was making $18 an hour.\\nJohnson: You were making more per hour than any of us. You would always float us at the bar. You were the rich one for the first 13 years of our friendship. I was really good at being frugal, though.\\nWere there hard feelings over your income disparity?\\nJohnson: Not really. Nat was always very generous. If I couldn't afford to go out, she'd be like, 'Come out, I'll cover you.' So I didn't ever feel like I was being a burden. I mean, it's not like I was ordering top shelf or anything. I wasn't going to take advantage.\\nWhen did finances start to shift for you?\\nVallot: Around 2010, I quit being a nanny and went back to school for nursing. So it was a struggle for a while. Me and my husband Billy were definitely at our poorest at that point.\\nJohnson: And right when you went back to school, that's when my YouTube channel began taking off. In 2011, I was making enough to quit my day job.\\nWhen did you realize you didn't have to worry about money anymore?\\nJohnson: My partner and producer Chris and I wanted to buy furniture as a backdrop for some food photography. So we went to Ikea and spent $300 on a chest. It wasn't cheap. It was the good Ikea stuff. We put it on a business credit card because it was a business expense, and I remember thinking, 'Oh, I do have some money now.' And that was weird.\\nAround this time, you two were in very different financial circumstances. Did this disparity lead to any awkward situations?\\nVallot: When I turned 40, all our friends wanted me and my husband to celebrate in Hawaii. And we couldn't afford it, so our friends bankrolled us. I remember a friend saying, 'How much can you all afford?' and I told her my number, and she said, 'OK, that's how much you're paying.' That was nice. But my friends just subsidized and subsidized.\\nJohnson: My approach to money is I feel like it's all going to come out in the wash, as long as nobody feels like they're getting taken advantage of. For the Hawaii trip, I remember thinking, this is what we have to do for Natalie. I was happy to pitch in because I wanted y'all to go. And it was your 40th birthday, and we had so much fun. It would be dumb if you weren't allowed to go because you couldn't afford it.\\nDid you feel weird about it?\\nVallot: I did at first. I think it does make you try to behave yourself. Like, we all went to the grocery store to pick out the food we wanted for the trip, and I was like, 'I'll eat whatever.' I didn't feel like I had a say because everyone else was paying for it. But I'm kind of like that, anyway, I'm flexible. Once we got there I realized, we're all here, and these are my sisters.\\nI wonder if it helps that you seem to have shared values when it comes to money?\\nJohnson: I just don't think that the amount of money you have is inherently tied to who you are as a person or your value as a person. That's a completely ridiculous idea. And maybe the fact that everyone in our friend group feels that way is what makes it easier to share it and not worry about it.\\nWhat advice do you have for other friends dealing with financial issues?\\nVallot: Give what you want to get back. I totally forgot that I was the moneybags when I was a nanny.\\nJohnson: I think, also, to be honest about what you can afford. Just say, 'I can't afford that. Can we pick something cheaper? Here's my budget, can you all work within that?' If your friends want to spend time with you, nobody's going to object. Don't be afraid to say, 'That's a little too pricey for me.'\\nHave you ever argued about money?\\nJohnson: No, and I think there might be two more reasons we've never argued over money. One is that we've never lived together or had a relationship where one person's money choices affected the other person's life.\\nAnd the second is that we've never borrowed or lent money between us. Everything has been given freely, with no expectations or strings attached. What's that old axiom about not lending money you can't afford to lose? I think we've always followed that, too.\\nVallot: I absolutely agree. I think respect is required to pull friendships through challenges, but having similar values is what grounds us.\",\"rights\":\"nytimes.com\",\"rank\":57,\"topic\":\"business\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Kristin Wong\",\"media\":\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/20/multimedia/00Friendship-Money-mtph/00Friendship-Money-mtph-facebookJumbo.jpg\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":\"@nytimes\",\"_score\":null,\"_id\":\"fc2949b133ed6dc988db04c366b91899\"},{\"title\":\"What to Know About Homeowners Insurance After Hurricane Helene\",\"author\":\"Ron Lieber\",\"published_date\":\"2024-09-27 21:10:45\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/business/hurricane-helene-homeowners-insurance.html\",\"clean_url\":\"nytimes.com\",\"excerpt\":\"If your home has been damaged, you may be at the beginning of a long process.\",\"summary\":\"If your home is damaged or destroyed because of Hurricane Helene, you're not alone.\\nThe insurance industry marshals all of its resources at a time like this, and you and your neighbors can commiserate and trade notes and tips.

slowing for months, which has paved the way for Federal Reserve interest rates cuts.\",\"summary\":\"Inflation cooled in August, the latest sign of progress in the Federal Reserve's yearslong fight to bring rapid price increases back under control.\\nThe Personal Consumption Expenditures index climbed by 2.2 percent from a year earlier, data released Friday showed. That is down from 2.5 percent in July and slightly softer than economist forecasts. It was the slowest annual inflation reading since early 2021.\\nAfter stripping out volatile food and fuel prices for a better sense of the underlying inflation trend, a 'core' price index was a bit more stubborn on an annual basis. The core measure came in at 2.7 percent, up from 2.6 percent previously and in line with what economists had expected. But comparing prices from month to month, core inflation slowed to a modest 0.1 percent in August.\\nAltogether, the report offers further proof that price increases are swiftly fading. Already, that has allowed the Fed to begin to lower interest rates from a more than two-decade high of 5.3 percent. After raising borrowing costs sharply and then holding them at a high level to slow the economy and weigh down inflation, officials voted last week to cut rates by a larger-than-usual half percentage point. Policymakers also signaled that more rate cuts are coming, as long as inflation continues to fade.\\nThe Fed's pivot is already helping to bring down mortgage rates, and it could slowly trickle through the economy to stop the job market from slowing more markedly. Central bankers are trying to pull off a rare 'soft landing,' in which they cool conditions enough to wrangle price increases without tempering them so much that unemployment spikes and the economy falls into a recession.\\nThere were some signs that the economy may be pulling back \\u2014 but not crashing \\u2014 in the details of Friday's report. Consumer spending, which makes up a big part of overall economic activity, grew more slowly in August, the data showed. And personal incomes picked up less than expected.\\nFed officials have been struggling to figure out what is happening with the economy, as overall growth and consumption numbers look strong but the job market slows.\\n'While a softening labor market suggests a weakening of economic activity, other economic measures suggest ongoing strength,' Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said in a recent essay.

S&P cut its rating on Thames's \\u00a315bn top-ranking debt pile by five notches to CCC+, taking it into the triple-C category that is considered very risky. Thames lost its investment-grade credit rating in July.\\nMoody's also slashed the firm's rating by five notches, to Caa1 from Ba2, saying: 'Inability to attract new equity funding may ultimately lead to a creditor-led debt restructuring or one that is imposed as part of a special administration process.'\\nThames is scrambling to shore up its finances, and admitted last week that it faces a shortage of cash as soon as December.

Without a rescue plan, the watchdog and the UK government may have to put Thames into a special administration regime, a form of renationalisation.\\nS&P said Thames's announcement last week about its finances was contrary to the rating agency's previous expectation in July that liquidity would last the company until May next year.\\nIt added: 'We believe Thames Water is now facing an acute near-term liquidity shortfall, and that, without any material positive developments, the issuer will likely restructure its debt within the next 12 months, which we would likely consider a default.'\\nS&P lowered its ratings on class A and class B debt, to CCC+ and CCC-, from BB and B previously, and assigned a negative outlook to both. Moody's said the utility had a 'significantly tighter liquidity position than previously expected'.\\nSome big lenders are considering easing repayment terms as Thames fights for survival, as they worry about their loans being wiped out if the company is temporarily nationalised.\\nTalks with creditors would only allow for enough funds to last until spring next year. Any agreement would therefore mark just a step on the road to a potential restructuring \\u2013 staving off the immediate risk of insolvency.\\nThames said: 'The announcement by the credit rating agencies is consistent with our liquidity position set out in our market statement last Friday. We continue to operate to the undertakings agreed with our regulator in July 2024 following the reduction in our class A debt rating to sub-investment grade and we continue to engage with creditors to consider options for the extension of our liquidity runway.

Never mind that Trian's stake is only 2.26%, and never mind that Peltz, famed for adventures at Heinz, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Disney and more, operates at the aggressive end of the activist investing spectrum. Better to have a shareholder pest on the inside.\\nThe standard Peltz tactic is to agitate for a shake-up, whether in the form of disposals, break-ups, relistings or simply better operational performance. All versions, conceivably, could apply at Rentokil. Its French unit that launders work garments looks an oddity in a company dominated by pest control with a smaller division that cleans offices. And a relisting in the US, to reflect the dominance of Rentokil's stateside revenues these days, is officially kept 'under review' already.\\nBut an operational kick is the priority, as everybody can see. Rentokil in 2021 paid $6.7bn at a fat takeover premium to buy Memphis-based Terminix, market leader in US pest control business. It used the dreaded word 'transformational' to describe a deal that was a departure from its usual diet of bolt-on small acquisitions. The cost savings seem to be arriving as advertised but the shocker a fortnight ago was virtual absence of growth in revenues when, only two months earlier, the company was banging on about 'positive momentum' in US pest control.\\nRentokil had to confess to being 'overresourced in both sales and service', thus the wide miss in profit forecasts. The shares plunged 20% on the day, the sort of move that tends to be remembered \\u2013 especially if, like Trian, you were stakebuilding just before the warning. Peltz's mood may not be improved by his terrible timing on this occasion.\\nIn theory, the operational troubles are all fixable. It's just that, almost three years after completion of the Terminix purchase, the business is still deep in the territory of branch closures and reorganisation. Meanwhile, its main US-listed rival, Rollins, enjoys a rising share price and 'strong' demand the last time it spoke: no shortage of customers or termites there. The contrast is stark \\u2013 a point Trian's new boardroom representative, its head of research Brian Baldwin, may be making.\\nAndy Ransom, the Rentokil chief executive since 2013 \\u2013 so architect of the misfiring Terminix deal but also of Rentokil's previously long and impressive turnaround \\u2013 will surely be looking over his shoulder.\\nSign up to Business Today\\nGet set for the working day \\u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning\\nafter newsletter promotion\\nPeltz's other current adventure in FTSE 100-land is Unilever, where he took a board position himself in 2022.

Though some participants and regulators balked at parts of the plan, the talks have continued and expanded into Europe and Canada.\\nOpenAI's blueprint for the world's technology future, which was described to The New York Times by nine people close to the company's discussions, would create countless data centers providing a global reservoir of computing power dedicated to building the next generation of A.I.\\nAs far-fetched as it may have seemed, Mr. Altman's campaign showed how in just a few years he has become one of the world's most influential tech executives, able in a span of weeks to gain an audience with Middle Eastern money, Asian manufacturing giants and top U.S. regulators.\\nIt was also a demonstration of the tech industry's determination to accelerate the development of a technology it claims could be as transformative as the Industrial Revolution.\\nWhen word leaked that Mr. Altman, 39, was looking for trillions of dollars, he was mocked for seeking investments equivalent to roughly a quarter of the annual economic output of the United States. Officials in Washington also expressed concerns that a U.S. company was trying to build vital technology in the Middle East. To build A.I. infrastructure in a number of countries, American companies would need approval from United States officials who oversee export controls.\\nMr. Altman has since scaled his ambition down to hundreds of billions of dollars, the nine people said, and hatched a new strategy: Court U.S. government officials by first helping to build data centers in the United States.\\nIt is still unclear how all this would work. OpenAI has tried to assemble a loose federation of companies, including data center builders like Microsoft as well as investors and chipmakers. But the particulars of who would pay the money, who would get it and what they would even build are hazy.\\nAt the same time, OpenAI has been in separate talks to raise $6.5 billion to support its own business, a deal that would value the start-up at $150 billion. The Emirates' technology investment firm, MGX, is among the group of potential investors, which also includes Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple and Tiger Global, three people familiar with the conversations said.\\nOpenAI is seeking cash because its costs far outpace its revenue, the three people said. It annually collects more than $3 billion in sales while spending about $7 billion.\\nSome of OpenAI's plans have been previously reported by Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters. Conversations with the nine people close to the talks, who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media, provide a fuller picture of the efforts and how the strategy has evolved.\\n(The Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft in December for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)\\nIn private conversations, Mr. Altman has compared the world's data centers to electricity, according to three people close to the discussions. As the availability of electricity became more widespread, people found better ways of using it. Mr. Altman hoped to do the same with data centers and eventually make A.I. technologies flow like electricity.\\nChatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT learn their skills by analyzing troves of digital data. But there is a shortage of the chips and data centers that drive this process. If that supply grows, OpenAI believes it can build more powerful A.I. systems.\\nIn dozens of meetings, OpenAI executives have prodded tech companies and investors to expand global computing power, the nine people close to the company's discussions said.\\n'Sam is thinking about how OpenAI remains relevant,' said Daniel Newman, chief executive of the Futurum Group, a tech research firm. 'It needs more compute, more connectivity, more power.'\\nMr. Altman's original plan called for the Emirates to fund the construction of multiple chip-making plants, which can cost as much as $43 billion each. The plan would reduce chip manufacturing costs for companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world's largest chip producer.\\nTSMC makes semiconductors for Nvidia, the leading developer of A.I. chips. The plan would allow Nvidia to churn out more chips. OpenAI and other companies would use those chips in more A.I. data centers.\\nMr. Altman and his colleagues discussed building the data centers in the Emirates, a nation with excess electrical power. In the United States, it has been hard for companies to build new data centers because there is not enough electrical power to run them.\\nOpenAI discussed funding the infrastructure plan with MGX, an A.I.-focused investment vehicle created by the Emirates. It also met with TSMC, Nvidia and another chip company, Samsung.\\nOmar Sultan Al Olama, the Emirates' minister of state for A.I., told The Times in a March interview that there 'is a business case' for going after such a giant deal.\\nNvidia declined to comment. MGX and Samsung did not respond to requests for comment.\\nOpenAI said in a statement that it was focused on building infrastructure in the United States 'with the goals of ensuring the U.S. remains the global leader in innovation, driving re-industrialization across the country and ensuring A.I.'s benefits are widely accessible.'\\nWill Moss, a spokesman for TSMC, said the company was open to discussions about expanding semiconductor development but was concentrating on its current global expansion projects and had 'no new investment plans to disclose at this time.'\\nWhen Mr. Altman visited TSMC's headquarters in Taiwan shortly after he started his fund-raising effort, he told its executives that it would take $7 trillion and many years to build 36 semiconductor plants and additional data centers to fulfill his vision, two people briefed on the conversation said. It was his first visit to one of the multibillion-dollar plants.\\nTSMC's executives found the idea so absurd that they took to calling Mr. Altman a 'podcasting bro,' one of these people said. Adding just a few more chip-making plants, much less 36, was incredibly risky because of the money involved.\\n'We are not, nor have we ever been considering multitrillion-dollar projects. While the total investment needed for the global infrastructure of A.I. to be fully built out by everyone could cost trillions over several decades, what OpenAI is specifically exploring is on the scale of hundreds of billions,' said Liz Bourgeois, an OpenAI spokeswoman.\\nAround the same time, Mr. Altman visited South Korea and held talks with two chipmakers in the country: Samsung and SK Hynix. But he soon ran into national security concerns over a prominent role for the United Arab Emirates in developing a technology that many consider critical to the economy and warfare.\\nSome White House officials and congressional leaders are afraid that approving the infrastructure to be built in the Emirates could give China a back door to important technologies. National security researchers have found evidence that some Emirati universities have worked with Chinese universities with ties to Beijing's military, said Sihao Huang, a technology fellow at the RAND Corporation.\\nTalks with the Department of Commerce, the Emirates and chipmakers are continuing. OpenAI has also expanded its discussions into other parts of the world, according to four people familiar with those talks.\\nIn the spring, company executives held meetings with Japanese officials in Tokyo. They laid out a plan for building data centers powered by electricity from nuclear power plants that were decommissioned after the Fukushima disaster in 2011.\\nDuring one meeting, a Japanese official laughed when OpenAI said it was seeking 5 gigawatts of electrical power, about a thousand times the power that an average data center consumes, a person familiar with the meeting said.\\nLater, in meetings with officials in Germany, OpenAI explored building a data center in the North Sea so it could tap into 7 gigawatts of power from offshore wind turbines, the person said.\\nBut political pressures have forced OpenAI to explore options in the United States. During a White House meeting with other tech leaders this month, Mr. Altman presented an OpenAI study called 'Infrastructure Is Destiny.'\\nThe study called for new data centers in the United States, two people familiar with the meeting said. Built at a cost of $100 billion each \\u2014 about 20 times the cost of today's most powerful data centers \\u2014 they would hold two million A.I. chips and consume 5 gigawatts of electricity.\\nAs he spoke, Mr. Altman sat in front of a portrait of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who poured money into massive infrastructure projects like New York's Lincoln Tunnel, two people familiar with the discussion said. The OpenAI chief told White House officials \\u2014 including Commerce Secretary Gina M.

Plotting one's way around a course requires a heightened understanding both of the venue itself and of one's game. But that is especially true at a team golf event, and over the years, the integration of statistics and modeling in the weeks and months leading up to those competitions has become more and more prevalent. Captains work with teams of statisticians to optimize player picks and pairings. The 'home' team does the same, with the additional responsibility of setting up the golf course to their players' advantage. Now more than ever, this type of preparation is pivotal to team golf, and remains true this week at the Presidents Cup.\\nAdvertisement\\nThe 14th playing of the biennial team competition \\u2014 which is held opposite to Ryder Cup years \\u2014 kicks off Thursday at Royal Montreal's Blue Course. The International Team has won the event just once, in 1998, and there has been one tie, in 2003. Since then the U.S. has dominated the series, most recently winning by five points at Quail Hollow in 2022.\\nBut could this year be more competitive than years past? Which players are more likely to find success on which parts of the golf course? Like any PGA Tour venue, Royal Montreal's 7,279-yard par-70 setup favors some skill sets more than others. Both the U.S. team and the International Team have been studying and breaking down the routing, prepping for a week of four-ball, foursomes and singles matches.\\nAfter conducting our own research, here's what we think they've deduced. Royal Montreal is a tight, tree-lined and classic-looking golf course that will accommodate players who are strong in the following areas: driving accuracy, 100-150-yard approach shots and proximity to the hole. All stats are via DataGolf.com.\\nAt Royal Montreal, accuracy off the tee will be heavily favored over driving distance due to the course's narrow fairways and thick rough, which will be particularly penal this year at about 3 inches in height. Most PGA Tour venues naturally give an advantage to the longest hitters (because it's always advantageous to be closer to the hole), but Royal Montreal has proven to be an exception to that trend. At the 2014 RBC Canadian Open \\u2014 the last PGA Tour-sanctioned event to be held at the course \\u2014 the winner, Tim Clark, ranked first in driving accuracy and 71st in driving distance. Of the next top 10 players on the leaderboard, seven were ranked within the top 15 in driving accuracy, and only three were ranked top 15 in the distance.\\nAdvertisement\\nAt Royal Montreal, the players who typically hit more fairways will have a clear advantage: The fairways are narrow, but they're not impossible to hold in the way Winged Foot was, for example. Accurate drivers of the ball will have a statistical sweet spot, where playing from the fairway more often and more reliably will set them up for success.\\nThis course fit attribute likely explains captain Jim Furyk's selection of Brian Harman. He was a controversial addition on this year's U.S squad, as the form that helped him with the 2023 Open Championship hasn't necessarily carried into this year. Despite being ranked 10th in the Presidents Cup standings, Harman has just three top-10 finishes in 2024 and one in his last six starts. But Harman is one of the straightest drivers in the world. He ranked No. 15 in driving accuracy, per Data Golf. The U.S. team also has the No. 3 and 4 most accurate drivers in the world in Collin Morikawa and Russell Henley, the latter another one of Furyk's captain's picks. Scottie Scheffler is one spot behind Harman at No. 16. The International Team has just two players ranked in the top 30 on that list: Si Woo Kim at No. 20 and Tom Kim at No. 28. Captain's pick Min Woo Lee, for example, ranks No. 274 in driving accuracy while being the second-longest player in the entire field. It'll be fascinating to see if they pair long and inaccurate players like Lee or Byeong-Hun An with more accurate drivers like the Kims.\\nOn the other side of the spectrum, however, the other four American captain's picks \\u2014 Tony Finau, Sam Burns, Keegan Bradley and Max Homa \\u2014 are all ranked outside the top 100 in accuracy, with Homa being the worst at No. 264.\\nOne key aspect to follow as pairings come out: All four par 3s are on odd-numbered holes and both par 5s are even. That could allow captains to hide poor drivers during alternate shot. For example, Max Homa and Wyndham Clark have been wild off the tee but remain pretty good ball strikers. Does Furyk keep them away from fourball and use them on odd numbers in foursomes?\\nIf mid-to-long irons were the sneaky key to Europe's convincing win at the 2023 Ryder Cup in Rome, there's a good chance short irons and wedges are the most important approach shots this year in Montreal. Most holes at Royal Montreal will leave players around 120 to 140 yards from the pin, especially with so many dog legs around water hazards making driver a risky decision. Even the shorter holes often require 4 irons off the tee, keeping that range in play often. If we once again use the 2014 Canadian Open as a helpful tool, four of the top seven finishers ranked top 20 that season in greens in regulation from 125-to-150 yards.\\nAdvertisement\\nThis is made even more interesting by comments Rory McIlroy made leading into Rome on the Subpar podcast about the course setup. 'If you break it down in terms of the parts of the game, we want to get wedges and short irons out of the Americans' hands,' McIlroy said. 'We know that that's what they're really good at.'\\nSo does that set up for a clear American advantage? Yes, but maybe not as much as you'd assume. The Americans do indeed have three of the five best approach players from 100-150 yards over the last two years, per DataGolf. Scottie Scheffler (No. 2), Russell Henley (No. 4) and Collin Morikawa (No. 5) all averaged more than 0.065 strokes gained in that range. Henley wasn't the sexiest of captain's picks but he thrives in both of these first two metrics.\\nGO DEEPER\\nPresidents Cup analysis: 10 notes to know on U.S. vs. International\\nThe Internationals have plenty of top players here too, though. Tom Kim ranks No. 7, while Hideki Matsuyama and captain's picks Corey Conners and Cristiaan Bezuidenhout all rank in the top 20. The U.S. certainly has the overall advantage as they round out a roster of players like Patrick Cantlay, Brian Harman, Sam Burns and Sahith Theegala all rating higher than the next-best international (Byeong Hun An), but it's an area both teams are solid in.\\nThe most notable U.S. team omission, Justin Thomas, ranks No. 6 in this category.\\nBear with us: Hitting the ball closer to the hole is important this week.\\nThat's true anywhere, but this is not a course where you simply need to find greens and be careful. This isn't Riviera, where short game and finding greens are everything because any missed green leaves a brutal recovery. The Royal Montreal greens are tiered with back-to-front slopes, with Cantlay saying it's necessary to find the right spots, but overall it isn't too penal for misses around the greens. There's less value in being able to find greens as there is in putting it close. Ipso facto, you're allowed to get aggressive.\\nWhile the PGA Tour proximity to the hole stat isn't necessarily perfect, as it could be more about being consistently average as opposed to what we're looking for, it's no surprise the world's best ball-striker Scheffler ranks No. 2 in average proximity. The PGA Tour doesn't explicitly track who hits the most shots within certain distances, but the great Justin Ray did some digging and found the tour average for approach shots inside 10 feet is 12.6 percent. The best on tour is Scheffler at 15.7 percent. The only other Presidents Cup participant at the top is Sam Burns, ranking fourth at 15.1 percent, making his captain's pick feel more valuable as somebody who might not be consistent but can get aggressive.\\nAdvertisement\\nMaybe an unscientific way of thinking about it is players who are skilled at getting 'hot' and going on birdie streaks. Scheffler, Morikawa, Burns and Theegala are some of the best at going on heaters. Schauffele is also somebody who is known for playing paint-by-numbers golf, but in reality he's one of the best in the world at hitting the shot he needs to hit. When he decided he needed to attack on Sunday at Valhalla, he went on a run of three birdies in four holes with dialed-in iron shots to win his first major. On the international side, Matsuyama is one of the streakiest players in the game, highlighted by his Sunday 62 to win the Genesis or consecutive 64s to win in Memphis.\\nYes, the United States are heavily favored for a reason. DataGolf gives the U.S. a 64.7 percent chance of winning, but team match play is not simply who is better across four days of stroke play. It's who is better in the right moments, who is better in the right areas and who manages the strategy of cup golf better.\\nAll in all, the top Americans to watch are some of the obvious. Scheffler is indeed the No. 1 player in the world and should play well, but one who fits Royal Montreal better than maybe anyone is Morikawa. His accurate driving and excellent iron game are a perfect fit. Outside of the obvious picks, Henley is an uber-reliable player who thrives in all the ways you want. Burns, meanwhile, offers an aggressive birdie machine with a good putter. Many \\u2014 including some on the International Team \\u2014 expect the U.S. to pair Burns with his best friend Scheffler again. If so, we'll see if they're able to improve on their winless record in four cup starts together.\\nMatsuyama is clearly the Internationals' ace. He's returned to form as a top-5-to-10 player in the world, and how International captain Mike Weir uses him will be crucial to their chances. Also watch for Tom Kim, Si Woo Kim and Sungjae Im as three Koreans well suited to the test Royal Montreal offers. All three are on the shorter side in driver distance while being accurate and have elite iron play. Considering putting tends to be less of an indicator here, that also helps Si Woo Kim.\\nThe International side is desperate to win their first Presidents Cup in 26 years, and the Americans want a win after a crushing Ryder Cup 12 months ago. Montreal is set to be a fantastic stage, and now you know what to watch for.\\n(Illustration: Meech Robinson / The Athletic: Photos: Harry How, Minas Panagiotakis / Getty Images; Keyur Khamar, Chris Condon / PGA Tour)\",\"rights\":\"nytimes.com\",\"rank\":57,\"topic\":\"business\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Brody Miller\",\"media\":\"https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2024/09/24182923/0925_RoyalMontrealCourseFits.png?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":\"@TheAthletic\",\"_score\":null,\"_id\":\"194c0de769412e4df1944e98205dcb2c\"},{\"title\":\"Co-operative Group returns to profit as almost \\u00a340m lost to shoplifting\",\"author\":\"PA Media\",\"published_date\":\"2024-09-25 08:50:12\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/25/co-operative-group-profit-shoplifting-wage-bill-retail\",\"clean_url\":\"theguardian.com\",\"excerpt\":\"Mutual reports half-year pre-tax profit of \\u00a358m despite soaring wage bill and rising cost of theft at retail stores\",\"summary\":\"The Co-operative Group has laid bare the impact of shoplifting as it said the cost of crime in its stores soared by nearly 20% to \\u00a340m in the first half of the year.\\nThe member-owned mutual has spent \\u00a318m so far this year on measures to protect staff in its food business, including rolling out body-worn cameras and fortified kiosks.\\nDespite this, the grocery chain took a hit of \\u00a339.5m from theft and fraud in the first six months of 2024 \\u2013 up 19% on a year earlier \\u2013 even as it increased campaigning on the problem.\\nMatt Hood, the managing director of food operations, said: 'It isn't going away.

'There is a concern about the timing, coming two weeks before the budget.\\n'People will want to know what the government's priorities are before committing investment.'\\nOne industry source said the government had only started to approach companies within the past two weeks about the event, expected to take place at a central London location \\u2013 a hurried timescale for a major summit \\u2013 with proposals to charge up to \\u00a3250,000 for attendance.\\nWhile questions remained over several key economic priorities, they said the investment summit, as it was described to them by officials, could amount to spending 'hundreds of thousands of pounds for a photo opportunity' with Keir Starmer or King Charles.\\nAnother said company chairs and chief executives were unlikely to attend, with several large firms planning to send more junior representatives \\u2013 including several large Wall Street banks.\\nGovernment sources insisted they were having no problems in attracting senior figures. Reynolds told bosses on Monday he was struggling to manage overwhelming demand, comparing it to 'planning a wedding list'.\\nLast week it emerged Larry Fink, the chief executive and chair of BlackRock, was being lined up to attend, according to Sky News, as the party battled suggestions that it would struggle to attract the 300 industry leaders it had pledged.\\nSpeaking at Labour's \\u00a33,000-a-head 'business day', taking place alongside its main conference, Reynolds said: 'The problem is not getting people to come, it's managing the interest. It's like planning a wedding.'\\nIt is understood some ministers have privately questioned the summit's timing, because companies were still awaiting clarity on tax and spending priorities due in the budget. Business surveys this week show uncertainty over the budget is weighing on Britain's economy, amid criticism that Reeves' warning of the need for 'tough' decisions was hitting confidence.\\nHowever, it is thought it would be too late to change course, having promised the summit would form a key role in the government's first 100 days. The City minister, Tulip Siddiq, said at a fringe event that the timing was in part due to the impact of the snap election on government schedules.\\nLabour sources also confirmed the government would not be ready to announce its industrial strategy ahead of the summit \\u2013 a policy which business chiefs have said will be important for steering investment in the economy.\\nIt is understood a green paper will be published alongside the budget to consult on its plans, before a full launch of the final plan early next year.\\nA chair of the industrial strategy council, which is expected to oversee the policy, has yet to be appointed, amid reports that ITV chief executive Carolyn McCall had snubbed the opportunity. The government is also yet to appoint an investment minister to coordinate business decisions with government.\\nMake UK's Phipson said companies needed clarity. 'Key appointments remain unannounced,' he said. 'For business to feel truly secure to make those longer term investments, meat on the bones of the industrial strategy must be a priority which comes at speed.'\\nJonny Haseldine, policy manager at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the summit would still send an 'important signal' that the UK was open for business, and that bosses could take the lead from Labour's outline commitments on tax.\\n'The direction of travel from government is encouraging. But businesses, both in the UK and overseas, will be keen to see more detail on competitive planning and tax policies, in order to achieve much needed growth,' he said.\\nChris Hayward, policy chair of the City of London Corporation, said the summit would be a key event to sell Britain to the world.

Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) chair, Gina Cass-Gottlieb, branded such savings 'illusory'.\\nThe executive at the Consumer Federation of Australia and deputy CEO at the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network (ACCAN), Gareth Downing, said a range of such retailer tactics make it difficult for shoppers to accurately and concisely compare prices.\\nHere are some others:\\nDowning pointed to the example of a 'seasonal discount' on items whose pricing remains the same year-round. He said the practice often affects durable products, such as a drying rack or barbecue equipment, creating the sense that it is a limited time offer, when it is not an offer at all.\\nBy law, unit prices must be displayed accurately, clearly and close to the item price. But their display was often non-compliant, Downing said.\\n'It's very hard to compare milk with other milk if you have a discount sticker over the top of the label and the unit price is in a size four font,' he said.\\nSign up for Guardian Australia's breaking news email\\nThe 'very harmful' practice affects both consumer pockets and the ability to foster vigorous pricing competition, he said.\\nIn March, the Consumer Action Law Centre told a Senate inquiry into supermarket prices that supermarket food prices must be fair and transparent \\u2013 and should not use their power and size to manipulate prices.\\nIf you've wondered why your box of cereal isn't going as far as it once did, you're not imagining it. Many products are getting smaller and more expensive, including Kellogg's Crunchy Nut, Sultana Bran and Froot Loops.\\nBy subtly reducing the size of a box of cereal while increasing its price, food manufacturers and supermarkets \\u2013 which ultimately set prices \\u2013 have resulted in price hikes of up to 82.1% for consumers.\\nRegular staples such as milk, bread and eggs are generally split up and positioned at the back of supermarkets. Shoppers then have to travel past other items to reach their target products, researchers told consumer watchdog Choice \\u2013 eventually leaving with more than they intended to buy.\\nImpulse purchases \\u2013 usually junk foods \\u2013 line checkout queues. It's a psychological tactic that leaves shoppers 'guilt-free' to opt for higher-cost 'treats' after picking up fruit, vegetables and staples, according to the watchdog.\\nSupermarkets are adjusting to the speedy shopper, grouping products together to help solve a problem, Choice has reported.\\nAmong products suggested for a Mexican dinner, in one example given, is usually a premium product with a large margin. The shopper saves time, but spends more than they otherwise might have.\\nBrands pay for prime position at aisle ends, known as 'end caps'. There, shoppers, who generally skirt the supermarket rather than venture down every aisle, are targeted by their displays, experts told Choice.\\nEncouraging customers to save money by buying several of one item when they only need one \\u2013 or none at all \\u2013 is an enduring tactic. These 'deals' have long been criticised by consumer groups for not saving shoppers money, or costing more.\\nAt Sydney-based Harris Farm Markets, signage has been used on punnets of blueberries, for example, implying buying several of the same item (advertised as 2 for $6) offers better value.

Phantom labels often cost less but result in retail companies squeezing out smaller brands.\\nThe tactic was perfected by Aldi, where the vast majority of products are own brand but are not generic or labelled Aldi. Coles, Woolworths, IGA and Foodworks have followed suit, with brands such as Koi, Cub, Thomas Dux, Community Co, Hillview, Smitten, Shine and Woofin' Good all cited as examples of generic supermarket lines with polished new images.\\nSupermarkets use price tags on normally priced products that are designed to mimic specials tags. On closer inspection, said Choice, the products do not appear to be discounted at all. This and the next four tactics are part of the watchdog's spotlight on 'dodgy' and 'shonky' promotions.\\nChoice has also drawn attention to the omission of contextual information that helps a customer determine how special a 'special' price is. A supermarket can label peaches at $3.90/kg as 'special' \\u2013 but the customer has nothing to compare the price with.\\nChoice made a complaint to regulators after Coles customers were told that low prices of some products were locked in until a certain date, only for the price to rise before that date. Coles apologised and refunded customers.\\nSupermarkets have used labels to advertise prices that have fallen, in one case comparing the current price with a higher price than that seven years ago.\\n'Because supermarkets don't publish historical pricing information, it's impossible for people to know if the price was actually cheaper a week ago', Choice said in its online petition calling for more price transparency.\\nGreen means fresh \\u2013 and red and yellow signal a bargain, retail experts have told Choice.

The reality of life, hockey and wins and losses at the NHL level tends to focus the attention of a hockey market more narrowly over time.\\nThe reality of camp, however, is different and more general. There are as many as 60 players on the ice at an NHL training camp, and a dizzying number of roster battles, drills and small details to pick up on.\\nSome of those small details, noticeable only to attentive observers, will come to shape a team's fortunes over the ensuing year, while others will turn out to be inconsequential going forward.\\nHaving ruminated on what we saw up in Penticton over the past week, here are five takeaways we think our readers should know from Vancouver Canucks training camp going into the preseason. 1. Buying high on the Canucks' rush potential\\nIt's clear that the Canucks, in analyzing their performance last season, have identified attacking off the rush as an essential way to improve going forward.\\nThis is the correct diagnosis. Vancouver ran extraordinarily pure from a scoring chance conversion perspective throughout last season, especially before the All-Star break, but generated five-on-five shots and rush chances like a clear non-playoff team. As talented as Vancouver's core group is, once this club's preposterous scoring efficiency came back to Earth last season, their team-level inability to consistently generate scoring chances at even strength became a genuine weakness, one that ultimately proved fatal to their ambitions in the second round of the playoffs.\\nIt's evident that the Canucks have thoughtfully approached making sure this year's team is more consistently dangerous off of the rush. And there's evidence of a holistic approach in diagnosing the issue, targeting the personnel who can help in this specific area \\u2014 adding Jake DeBrusk, Danton Heinen, Kiefer Sherwood and Daniel Sprong in free agency \\u2014 and then making systematic adjustments in how the Canucks play to take advantage of what their new wingers can add to the club's north-south attacking threat.\\nTraining camp was unusually focused on breakout drills and transition work. One drill especially caught our eye, given the breakout 'landmarks' Canucks head coach Rick Tocchet referenced throughout camp, in which the weak side winger slashes off of the wall and into the middle of the ice along the offensive blue line while the defender starts the breakout. Meanwhile, the centre moves to the weak side wall, and the strong side winger skates at full tilt into the zone.\\nThis breakout creates the option for a deflection into the zone or a skilled play from the weak-side winger who can attempt to send in one of their slashing teammates behind the defence out wide with a deft touch.\\nThis breakout we saw on Day 2 of camp accomplishes a couple of really interesting things for Vancouver. First off, it's a look that allows the team to attack at a remarkable pace through the neutral zone, which is key. Second, however, even if the Canucks can't regularly pull off the home run play on this breakout, the median outcome from it still takes advantage of the team's strengths.\\nVancouver has been an exceptional forechecking team over the past few years, and a variety of their key personnel \\u2014 from J.T. Miller and Elias Pettersson through to Dakota Joshua, Pius Suter, Nils H\\u00f6glander and Conor Garland \\u2014 excel at being disruptive forces as the first forward into the zone (the F1). If the weak-side winger can make a skilled play or weight a deflection so that their linemates get the puck at full pace and can challenge a defender out wide one-on-one, great. If the weak-side winger is simply able to deflect the puck into the zone, then the structure of the breakout serves to put Vancouver's disruptive centremen into position to be the F1, as opposed to the F3, which takes advantage of what Pettersson, Suter and Miller can accomplish as forecheckers \\u2014 while moving at incredible pace as the opposition defender attempts a retrieval.\\n'It's a weird drill because you're (cutting in), you're looking back, the puck could bounce weird,' said DeBrusk. 'But it's about the thought process, not really about the reps being super clean. \\u2026 As forwards, we're going and we're going to certain spots. Anytime you know where you should be going on the ice, it gives you a better chance. Even if there's a breakdown, it's organized.'\\nThat's the point, structurally. Theoretically, either way, it should work.\\nWe saw from the Tocchet, Patrik Allvin and Jim Rutherford troika last season how the club was able to thoughtfully approach taking a quantum leap forward as a defensive team: Get big defenders, get forwards with pace who can backcheck, manage the puck conservatively in the offensive zone and get cult-like buy-in, and one of the league's most permissive units became one of its stingiest year over year. It was a remarkable turnaround.\\nWe're not necessarily predicting the Canucks will have the same level of worst-to-first success upgrading as a rush-attacking team this season, but watching the team work on rush drills during camp, it certainly had the explicit look and feel of a plan coming together.\\n'Wanting to play faster, wanting to use my speed, that's something they said they liked about me,' DeBrusk said, recalling the conversations he had with management during the summer. 'They wanted to play a transition game and they thought I could fit into that.' 2. It's going to be hard for forwards to crack this roster\\nWe spend a lot of time during camp and the preseason talking about roster battles, but in truth, in the NHL's hard cap era, most rosters are 90-95 percent set before the puck drops at training camp.\\nOpportunity is scant, and when it arrives, it's more likely to arrive in-season or as a result of injury, as opposed to because a certain player won a roster spot outright at camp \\u2014 although that does happen.\\nThere are definitely jobs available in this Canucks lineup, but the competition is more about minutes and roles, as opposed to being about roster spots. That competition will largely play out between a variety of players \\u2014 guys like Heinen, Sherwood and H\\u00f6glander \\u2014 who are clearly bound for the NHL roster.\\nLet's illustrate this directly. Here's how we're projecting Vancouver's forward lines, for now, with what we feel very confident about filled out directly and the jobs that are still a matter of internal competition marked with an 'X' as unknown.\\nSo that's five jobs for wingers available until Joshua returns to the lineup. And here are those contenders, which we've tiered below.\\nThe tiers reflect the following criteria: In the top tier are the obvious NHL players on contracts who can't be fully buried in the American League. At the very least they'll fill out the fourth-line wing spots. We put Jonathan Lekkerim\\u00e4ki in his own tier given he's never played an NHL game and is on an entry-level contract. We also put Daniel Sprong in his own tier because the club values the right-handed shooting and power-play utility enough that they chased him in free agency, but at his annual average value, nothing is guaranteed. The next group consists of depth wingers the Canucks utilized when the chips were down in the playoffs last season. And the next tier includes Sammy Blais, who is on a PTO, and Arshdeep Bains, who the club didn't turn to in the playoffs last season.\\nWhen you really diagram it, there's minimal opportunity available for the Lekkerim\\u00e4ki, Linus Karlsson, Bains and even Phillip Di Giuseppe tier of winger this preseason. Maybe there's one open job available on the NHL roster, and even that opportunity may only exist short term as a result of Joshua's indefinite absence. 3. That said, Lekkerim\\u00e4ki enters the preseason with a shot\\nRight off the bat, Lekkerim\\u00e4ki can attack off the rush at a professional level. We know the club has prioritized improving in that area more than any other this offseason. That would seem to create some favourable headwinds for the 20-year-old rookie, especially given his play off the puck looked more advanced than we expected throughout camp.\\nCertainly, Lekkerim\\u00e4ki turned the heads of his teammates and linemates in Penticton.\\n'He's ahead of where I was when I broke into the league, in terms of making plays,' DeBrusk said of Lekkerim\\u00e4ki. 'I was more simple at his age, I was scared to make a play. I'd just get downhill and get to the net. I was playing with David Krejci, I was more so trying to drive it. Give it to Krejci at all costs, kick out and go to the net and fly. He sees the game really well, and you learn as you play, but he's ahead of where I was at that age.'\\nLekkerim\\u00e4ki will still have work to do in preseason action to earn a look when the regular season begins, but we should elevate how realistically we're viewing the possibility of him being a Game 1 option for Tocchet. It's still early, but it seems like it's trending toward being a serious consideration. 4. Why the Kevin Lankinen addition should be a huge relief for Canucks fans\\nAs impressed as we were by the upgraded speed and rush attacking focus at Canucks training camp, we were equally worried about the state of Vancouver goaltending.\\nThose concerns were allayed somewhat as the weekend rolled along, especially after Art\\u016brs \\u0160ilovs stole the show at the scrimmage and the Canucks signed Kevin Lankinen. Still, when you consider the full picture, it does feel like the other side of the coin in comparison with how the Canucks thoughtfully approached levelling up as an attacking team this offseason.\\nWhere the upgraded rush personnel feels like a thoughtful part of a whole, the vibes in net for the Canucks couldn't be worse. The club has cast goalie coach Ian Clark's departure as a surprise, which hangs over this somewhat, especially given how Clark's star pupils have historically fared in their first seasons away from his tutelage. Then there's the uncertainty about Thatcher Demko, as he attempts to recover from an unprecedented muscular injury, which will linger even after he returns.\\n\\u0160ilovs has a lot of talent, but he's battled inconsistency in his professional career. Ji\\u0159\\u00ed Patera didn't look the part of a credible NHL option at camp. Nikita Tolopilo is obviously talented but hasn't had a game of NHL experience yet.\\nWhen you consider the whole picture, adding a veteran like Lankinen, with a real NHL body of work as an average goalie, feels like a huge relief. Even if we buy Tocchet's argument that the Canucks will be able to fall back on their sturdy defensive form to insulate whoever is in net, and we should, adding Lankinen is a key steadying move. It should help the Canucks avoid any worst-case scenarios. 5. What if Kirill Kudryavtsev is NHL-ready?\\nVancouver's 2022 seventh-round pick Kirill Kudryavtsev turned heads at Young Stars and during training camp.\\nThe young Russian-born defender even earned a promotion during camp, the only significant lineup change the Canucks made to either of their NHL-level groups, and was elevated to play alongside Tyler Myers.\\nThough Kudryavtsev didn't shine in the scrimmage necessarily, there's a lot about his game \\u2014 the puck-moving ability, the versatility to fill in on the right side, the lack of panic, the weight on his passes \\u2014 that looks NHL level, or thereabouts, right now.\\nNow, obviously that's an exciting prospect for the Canucks. Teams are always in need of credible options on the back end, and Kudryavtsev might be one in the short term. It's important to distinguish, however, between a player who's ready early and a player with significant NHL upside.\\nSometimes players, especially somewhat undersized left-handed defenders like Michael Del Zotto or Victor Mete in the past, are capable of making an instantaneous NHL impact upon leaving the major junior ranks. And ultimately those players are still more likely to top out as NHL-level depth options throughout their career, as opposed to top-four horses NHL teams can count on to log major minutes on a winning team.\\nIf Kudryavtsev plays NHL games for the Canucks this season, or even pushes to make the team out of camp (although that seems far less likely), that would be an incredible development for Vancouver. It would give the club a ton of options, and also a valuable out-of-nowhere trade asset to consider spending on higher-leverage upgrades.\\nAs I considered Kudryavtsev's progress and readiness this week, the crucial distinction between a prospect's arrival date and their probable upside stuck in my mind. It's something to keep in mind if Kudryavtsev can stick around as the roster reductions accelerate once we get into the NHL preseason.\\n(Photo of Brock Boeser, Elias Pettersson and Nils H\\u00f6glander: Harry How / Getty Images)\",\"rights\":\"nytimes.com\",\"rank\":57,\"topic\":\"business\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Thomas Drance\",\"media\":\"https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2024/09/23145815/GettyImages-2144827444-e1727117938843.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":\"@TheAthletic\",\"_score\":null,\"_id\":\"f9ba9ed2e757bc0200db36e1150356cd\"},{\"title\":\"US labor watchdog pressures Trader Joe's to bargain with New York union\",\"author\":\"Michael Sainato\",\"published_date\":\"2024-09-24 11:00:03\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/24/trader-joes-union\",\"clean_url\":\"theguardian.com\",\"excerpt\":\"Company may be ordered to recognize union amid allegations employees were threatened during election\",\"summary\":\"Mobilizing workers at a Trader Joe's store on New York's Lower East Side marginally lost a union election last year.

Facing a slew of allegations around its handling of unionizing efforts, the retailer has claimed the NLRB is unconstitutional, filing legal papers challenging the federal agency alongside firms including Elon Musk's SpaceX, Amazon and Starbucks.\\nWorkers who tried to unionize at its store on the Lower East Side of New York lost the election in a 76-76 tied vote in April 2023.

'They wouldn't do that if we didn't have quite a lot to gain from it.'\\nWorkers pushed to unionize in response to issues they experienced through the Covid-19 pandemic, safety problems and having benefits scaled back over the years, according to Arend, who claimed broad support during early efforts to organize. 'To see how the corporation so harshly stamped that out was really heartbreaking,' she said.\\nTrader Joe's workers at the store 'know kind of the extent of the illegal union busting that's happened', Arend claimed. 'We've experienced it firsthand. But to see it actually being dealt with is really exciting.'\\nTrader Joe's declined to comment on the consolidated complaint, or the request for a Cemex bargaining order. The company has until 1 October to respond. An administrative law judge hearing is scheduled to rule on the complaint in January.\\nSarah Beth Ryther, vice-president of Trader Joe's United and a worker at a unionized store in Minneapolis, said: 'This is a company that has proven time and again that they are unafraid of using really coercive tactics in order to stop workers from exercising their rights.\\n'We've built over the past two years a really strong network of organizers at organized and unorganized stores and that advocacy is slow, but we're trying through bargaining trying to put as much pressure on the company as possible.'\",\"rights\":\"theguardian.com\",\"rank\":75,\"topic\":\"business\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Michael Sainato\",\"media\":\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/855e4276339e7394085c087e135d1f1ee5f33bf1/0_174_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c3658ce687d297b2972361707e7dad1b\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":\"@msainat1\",\"_score\":null,\"_id\":\"905e9b86c3742d2516975db029476dae\"},{\"title\":\"England v Australia: third men's one-day cricket international\",\"author\":\"James Wallace\",\"published_date\":\"2024-09-24 10:55:46\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2024/sep/24/england-v-australia-third-one-day-cricket-international-live\",\"clean_url\":\"theguardian.com\",\"excerpt\":\"Over-by-over report: Join our writers for updates as England try and keep the five-match series alive in Durham\",\"summary\":\"Show key events only Please turn on JavaScript to use this feature\\nProper Criggit: Share James Wallace\\nHello and welcome to the OBO of the third England v Australia ODI from Durham.

The government said that all consignments that had been held up and tested were found to have traces of the pest and these robust checks had stopped them from entering the country.\\nHowever, affected suppliers have been highly critical of the lack of communication as to why the goods were being held, with the HTA saying the lack of clear information was 'completely unacceptable'.\\nVincenzo Marini, the chief executive of haulage company Marini, which sends 15 lorries a week to Britain, told the Guardian that one of his drivers was forced to stay in Kent, near Sevington, for six days after his company received no information on why their load had been held and when it would be released.\\nSpeaking last week, he said: 'The lorry has now been blocked for eight days and today I had to switch drivers \\u2013 the first one was sleeping in the lorry all this time.\\n'How could I leave him there without any information on how long this would take? We are kept in the dark about everything.'\\nMarini, who has been sending good since the 1980s, added: 'The UK is putting me into huge difficulties. I know other companies that have lost drivers, too, and so they have abandoned the UK due to this mess.'\\nAnother affected Italian supplier, which preferred not be named, said it had now paused deliveries to the UK over concerns that similar holdups would take place, leaving a number of UK customers waiting for deliveries.\\nSign up to First Edition\\nOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters\\nafter newsletter promotion\\nThe company, which relies on the UK for 60% of its business, said there had been no communication about what had happened and many of the support lines were engaged when they tried to contact support agencies.\\nA spokesperson for the company said: 'Since the checks, transport costs have gone up a lot because lorries are now having to often wait five or six hours for these checks and you have to put the prices up.\\n'The drivers don't want to go because they are getting sick and tired of waiting.'\\nThis is the latest in a line of holdups at the border, with lorries being held for more than a day earlier in the year after IT outages led to long delays of perishable goods coming into the country.\\nTransport en Logistiek Nederland, which represents 5,000 Dutch transport companies, told the Guardian earlier this year that some of its members could start rejecting jobs because of the new delays at the border, with the average driver being held for more than four hours.\\nIn its letter, the HTA called for border agencies to improve communication with their service users more clearly, and called for an urgent roundtable with ministers to discuss its concerns.\\nA government spokesperson said: 'We are committed to reducing barriers to trade and cutting red tape by striking a fair balance between business and biosecurity.\\n'Physical checks play an important role in helping stop harmful plant and animal diseases reaching our shores, as can be seen from detecting non-native plant pests found in these consignments'.\",\"rights\":\"theguardian.com\",\"rank\":75,\"topic\":\"business\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Angela Giuffrida,Jack Simpson\",\"media\":\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79284c66bd9e1d55c08103e04786469e4787fc00/0_445_5500_3299/master/5500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bea8abd93c482cb31ce8bb32ffbf4480\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":\"@guardian\",\"_score\":null,\"_id\":\"a8b09a306077af3510e3892f14d33db8\"},{\"title\":\"China Is Striking Deals to Cement Its Role as Asia's Trade Hub\",\"author\":\"Keith Bradsher\",\"published_date\":\"2024-09-24 04:00:16\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/business/china-trade-russia-north-korea.html\",\"clean_url\":\"nytimes.com\",\"excerpt\":\"Beijing's leaders are working with regional neighbors on the country's western, northern and southern borders to develop new rail and sea links.\",\"summary\":\"China has made several moves in recent months to advance its ambitious aim to become the trade and transportation hub of Asia.\\nTo its west, China has agreed to build a rail line across Central Asia.

Today, AI is rapidly becoming a key tool in our lives, embedded into activities from work and leisure to social policy, the justice system and even warfare. But AI's meteoric rise, while offering huge benefits to society, is creating significant concerns, with world leaders and AI experts \\u2013 including Hinton himself \\u2013 warning of multiple dangers and calling for greater regulation of the technology.\\nAI's risks range from the disruption of employment and embedding systemic bias into decision making, to the spread of disinformation and the existential threat of a 'superintelligence' acting beyond human control.\\nTo tackle such threats and harness the beneficial powers of this technology, the University of Toronto's Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society is supporting interdisciplinary research, debate and educational programmes in this area. The aim is to encourage AI developers and policymakers to take a holistic, ethical approach, for the overall benefit of humanity, to the AI systems they develop and implement.\\n'Education must adapt to this new world. We need a whole slew of people working together to figure out the right way to control and regulate AI. The important thing is that we act now,' says David Lie, director of the Schwartz Reisman Institute and a cyber security expert.\\nThe Schwartz Reisman Institute brings together scholars and students from diverse fields such as computing, philosophy, psychology, law and public policy to study the impacts of technology on society. The institute, which has recently appointed renowned AI safety experts Roger Grosse and David Duvenaud as Schwartz Reisman chairs in technology and society, seeks to keep policymakers, technologists and the public informed about the regulation and ethical standards of AI and other technologies. The institute uses a multidisciplinary approach to outline practical solutions to the problems and risks that technology presents to humanity.\\nAI is an area of growing capability and concern, with stark warnings issued by Hinton \\u2013 University of Toronto professor emeritus and 'godfather of AI' \\u2013 about the dangers of the technology he helped invent. In a recent paper in the journal Science, he joined 25 experts \\u2013 including Sheila McIlraith, professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto and associate director at Schwartz Reisman \\u2013 in highlighting critical problems with AI that needed to be addressed.\\nThe experts called for a greater focus on research and development to ensure AI systems align with human values, for more informed regulation, better oversight of AI systems, and greater understanding of how AI makes decisions.\\nIn a collaborative initiative to address these issues, the Schwartz Reisman Institute has teamed up with the University of Toronto's Department of Computer Science to create a series of course modules on ethics that are embedded into the university's existing computer science undergraduate curriculum. The Embedded Ethics Education Initiative (E3I) aims to implant the seeds of a more thoughtful approach to AI and other technology in the minds of the technology leaders of the future.\\n'We want students to develop ethical sensitivity because they will be on the frontlines when they enter the workforce,' says McIlraith. 'They'll be the ones writing the code, developing the systems and using the data. It is imperative that ethical considerations are part of the fundamental design principles.'\\nMcIlraith says that undergraduates have limited life experiences and may be inclined to build technology that pushes boundaries, rather than contemplating the diversity of stakeholders and end users who may be affected by it, and designing the technology for them. Many of these students go on to work at the big tech firms once they graduate, so learning to identify stakeholders and build technology that benefits this diverse collective is crucial.\\n'We wanted to start the conversations about the ethical side of AI early on, but we absolutely did not want to proselytise. Our aim has been to broaden their thinking about AI's impacts on society through the insertion of ethics modules into select computer science courses rather than to lay down the law,' she says.\\nThe Embedded Ethics Education Initiative integrates ethical concepts into existing courses on specific areas of computing. For instance, a course on computer games includes a discussion about drawing a line between designing games that are highly engaging from those that are addictive. Another course raises questions of privacy in the use of facial recognition technology and how the risks can be mitigated.\\nThe initiative began in 2020 and is being expanded to other courses beyond computer science. In the 2023/24 academic year, total enrolment in computer science courses with E3I programming has exceeded 8,000 students, and another 1,500 students participated in E3I programming in courses outside computer science.\\nAnother initiative is a new course to be run next year by Schwartz Reisman Institute director Lie with associate director Lisa Austin, who is also chair in law and technology at the University of Toronto. The course, digital privacy and privacy regulation, will bring together law and engineering students to jointly tackle problems, learning from each other about the technological and legal implications of a variety of developments in AI and technology.\\n'This multidisciplinary approach to education is a departure from how things are normally done in universities,' says Lie. 'But given the way technology is expanding across society, it doesn't make sense to teach technology separately from everything else that we do.'\\nLie believes that a cross-disciplinary strategy for training AI developers and policymakers is the key to creating a society at ease with AI.\\n'A measure of success would be the creation of a healthy ecosystem where, on balance, we are better off with the AI systems than without them. It will be a society where regulation is carefully and intelligently written and well implemented,' he says.\\n'My vision is to make us one of the leaders. Canada has already contributed greatly to machine learning and AI through the contributions of previous scholars such as Hinton, and I think we have an important role to play in this technology going forward.'\\nMeet the extraordinary community that's pushing the boundaries of what's possible\",\"rights\":\"theguardian.com\",\"rank\":75,\"topic\":\"business\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"David Benady\",\"media\":\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2f9fc1bbfa8f54a8834306808eb7b64a55db09b/0_52_1050_630/master/1050.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=39a44996ab4de1c517ea3aacad1ee4ef\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":\"@guardian\",\"_score\":null,\"_id\":\"a8b32169782258de2b0482b1e675d7d8\"},{\"title\":\"Five takeaways from Craig Counsell's blunt assessment that the Cubs aren't good enough\",\"author\":\"Patrick Mooney\",\"published_date\":\"2024-09-23 10:15:14\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5786843/2024/09/23/craig-counsell-cubs-arent-good-enough\",\"clean_url\":\"nytimes.com\",\"excerpt\":\"'We have to push each other in these situations,' Counsell said.\",\"summary\":\"CHICAGO \\u2014 Chicago Cubs manager Craig Counsell delivered a message that was both so direct and vague enough that it sounded like he called out his entire organization. 'We should be trying to build 90-win teams here' instantly landed as a line that will be repeated throughout another long winter.\\nThe Cubs don't consistently spend money like the Los Angeles Dodgers or New York Yankees, and they don't regularly do more with less, the way the Milwaukee Brewers created that 'big gap' in the National League Central. Year after year, though, the big crowds keep showing up to Wrigley Field, win or lose.\\nCounsell didn't specifically mention Cubs chairman Tom Ricketts, president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer, general manager Carter Hawkins or president of business operations Crane Kenney. But the business and baseball sides of the franchise would ideally create some sort of synergy. Raising the expectations and instilling a greater sense of urgency will be a group effort.\\n'We have to push each other in these situations,' Counsell said. 'That inevitably is going to make for hard decisions. Because it's hard. The thing we want to do is hard. That's going to require hard decisions. But the things worth doing are hard. That's where we got to get to. It's going to be difficult. We're not there.'\\nIt's more about process than personnel\\n'Absolutely,' Counsell said. 'I would jump to process.'\\nCounsell didn't mean that everyone should be fired and the team has to start over. His power, even with a five-year, $40 million contract, isn't unlimited. Parts of the roster are locked into place. But his vast knowledge of the inner workings of Milwaukee's system has given him a different perspective. And the process of evaluating could lead to personnel changes.\\n'It entails everything,' Counsell said. 'You're looking for details. I don't think it's appropriate for me to share some of the details. But it requires us to look in every area, for sure.'\\nDon't focus on the positives\\nKey questions in spring training revolved around: How would Shota Imanaga handle his adjustment to MLB? When would the young talent arrive? And who's on third? The Cubs had already retained the nucleus of an 83-win team and hired one of the best managers in the game, giving them a solid floor.\\nImanaga, who threw seven scoreless innings in Sunday's 5-0 win over the Washington Nationals, is 15-3 with a 2.91 ERA. Pete Crow-Armstrong emerged as a dynamic center fielder. Michael Busch (21 homers, .783 OPS) proved himself as an everyday first baseman. Isaac Paredes, an All-Star third baseman, was added around the trade deadline. Yet the division race still was not close.\\nShota Imanaga has the 3rd most strikeouts by a @Cubs rookie since 1920! pic.twitter.com/sK8mDmSlak\\n\\u2014 Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) September 22, 2024\\n'Seasons like this, there are successes, and there are things that aren't good enough,' Counsell said. 'That leads to your record. That's earned. And none of those are promised \\u2014 the successes or the failures \\u2014 moving forward. That's one of the difficult parts about evaluating teams as well. Obviously, we've got to maximize those successes again. We've got to create more successes. Clearly, there wasn't enough.'\\nYoung pitching can't be trusted yet\\nThe Cubs are planning to add an established starting pitcher to a group that includes Imanaga, Justin Steele, Jameson Taillon and Javier Assad. There's ample room for a free agent who would be expected to make 30 starts and could be trusted in a playoff game. It's a clear way to improve one of the team's strengths while also creating options for the bullpen and more depth at Triple-A Iowa. Names like Ben Brown, Jordan Wicks, Hayden Wesneski and Cade Horton should factor into next year's plans, but more as reserves or in supporting roles.\\n'In one sense, you feel like you're in a solid position because we have a number of young pitchers (who) have had success in the big leagues,' Counsell said. 'Now with all of them, there's been injuries. And it's not a big sample as of yet. But that's also kind of the nature of pitching. It's the nature of young pitching. So we're in a good spot in terms of that area of depth. But as we saw this year, it disappeared quickly.'\\nBuilding around Wrigley Field's unpredictability would be a mistake\\nCounsell won't overreact to how the Friendly Confines played this season, turning into one of the worst ballparks for hitters, almost on par with Seattle's T-Mobile Park: 'I don't know what the weather's going to be next year. Until we know that, just get good players.'\\nThere are only theories \\u2014 such as all the construction around Wrigleyville in recent years \\u2014 but no concrete answers about the wind patterns and future conditions. Counsell clearly believes this roster needs significant changes, but Wrigley Field alone is not a reason to seek out different types of offensive players.\\n'Who knows what the weather's going to be?' Counsell said. 'It led to a lower run-scoring environment (this year). We pitched really, really well here. It was hard to score runs at Wrigley Field this year for both sides. It was the nature of the weather this year. That played a part in it. But making personnel decisions on that at this point doesn't seem logical.'\\nProspects can wait until next year\\nWith the Cubs mathematically eliminated from the playoff race, the final week of the season could have been a chance for the club to take a look at Kevin Alc\\u00e1ntara and Owen Caissie. Counsell, however, said, 'There's no plans for that right now.'\\nAlc\\u00e1ntara, the 6-foot-6 center fielder acquired in the Anthony Rizzo trade, is already on the 40-man roster. Caissie, the left-handed slugger who was packaged in the Yu Darvish deal, will be added this winter to protect him from the Rule 5 draft. Alc\\u00e1ntara and Caissie are part of a strong group of position players who ended this season at the Triple-A level. Counsell has been trying to maintain an all-162 mentality.\\n'Nothing changes,' Counsell said. 'You just go out and you play the game. You respect the game. You respect your teammates. That's it.'\",\"rights\":\"nytimes.com\",\"rank\":57,\"topic\":\"business\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Patrick Mooney\",\"media\":\"https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2024/09/22213143/USATSI_24245348-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":\"@TheAthletic\",\"_score\":null,\"_id\":\"3e98abe3abcb2077ab3359b149b5c58e\"},{\"title\":\"REA Group makes third offer to buy Rightmove, worth \\u00a36.1bn\",\"author\":\"Graeme Wearden\",\"published_date\":\"2024-09-23 05:58:01\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/sep/23/rea-group-makes-third-offer-to-buy-rightmove-worth-61bn-business-live\",\"clean_url\":\"theguardian.com\",\"excerpt\":\"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, as Australia's REA Group sweetens its bid for Rightmove again\",\"summary\":\"Show key events only Please turn on JavaScript to use this feature\\nGood morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy.\\nWhen bidding for property, it's important not to take no for an answer.

Australia's REA Group is taking this advice seriously, and has just launched its third offer to buy UK housing portal Rightmove.\\nAfter being rebuffed twice this month, REA has upped its offer again. It is now proposing to pay around \\u00a36.1bn for the UK's biggest online property portal.\\nREA's offer is worth 770p per Rightmove share \\u2013 structured as 341p in cash and 0.0422 new REA shares\\nIn a statement to the Australia stock market this morning, Owen Wilson, CEO of REA, insisted the deal made sense, saying:\\n'We believe that the combination of our world-leading expertise and technology with the attractive Rightmove business will create an enhanced experience for agents, buyers and sellers of property.\\nWe live in a world of intensifying competition and this proposed transaction would bring together two highly complementary digital property businesses for investment and growth.\\nWilson added that REA is 'genuinely disappointed at the lack of engagement by Rightmove's Board'.\\nREA made its first approach to Rightmove on 5 September, when it proposed paying 705p per share, or \\u00a35.6bn. That was rebuffed, with Rightmove's board saying it 'fundamentally' undervalued the company.\\nThen on Friday night, news broke that REA had increased its offer by \\u00a3300m. Rupert Murdoch's REA group ups offer for Rightmove to \\u00a35.9bn\\nRightmove weren't commenting officially on that offer yesterday, but Bloomberg reported that 'people familiar with the matter'' said it had been rejected.\\nNow, Rightmove's board must ponder this third offer.\\nThe company's shares closed at 674p on Friday night (before news of the second offer broke), which values Rightmove at \\u00a35.32bn.

Every season is strange in its own way, I concede, but this one seems extreme. There is just a paucity of points and many of those that come are from our benches or the waiver wire. The inefficiency measured this way is off the charts.\\nThe Dolphins offense was as 'frag-i'lay' as the leg lamp in 'A Christmas Story.' Yet the Dolphins had no Plan B for life without Tua Tagovailoa. I did not get the De'Von Achane victory laps last week after his heavy workload. Those touches just don't mean much if the offense can't function, and this one can't without Tua.\\nPlan C is Jets 2023 castoff Tim Boyle. You probably have to play Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle given they still rank somewhere in the top 40 at their position, but it's brutal. There's no guarantee that Tagovailoa is going to be back after three more games, either. The NHL 's New York Rangers had a player who missed 70 games after repeated concussions. It's in the doctor's hands now.\\nMiami averaged 3.7 yards per play against a defense that could not stop New England last week.\\nThere should be a running back change in Tampa Bay. Rachaad White is terrible. Bucky Irving has been solid.\\nBucs RBs this season:\\nRachaad White:\\n31 ATT, 66 Rush YDS, 2.1 YPC\\nBucky Irving:\\n25 ATT, 154 Rush YDS, 6.2 YPC\\n\\u2014 Frank Ammirante (@FAmmiranteTFJ) September 22, 2024\\nSome people thought Denver 's Javonte Williams scored from in close but the play was reviewed. After that, on fourth down, Jaleel McLaughlin had one of the best runs I've seen in that situation. Williams later fumbled, leading to a Bucs TD. But a third RB, Tyler Badie, was inserted into the mix, and he was by far the most effective. So this is a mess.\\nI may as well concede defeat with Malik Nabers. Clearly the Cardinals made a bigger mistake than me in not drafting Nabers over Marvin Harrison Jr. in reality. But I thought the price for Nabers was WR25, at best, and he was going at WR19 at the end of draft season. That was clearly a bargain. Last week, we could have discounted the volume for (lack of) quality of the opponent (the Commanders). But the Browns are a good defense.\\nDaniel Jones looked competent. A lot of this had to do with Nabers, of course. Usually the receiver has to be the last piece, a mantra first preached by Bill Walsh. But Nabers seems to be a rare exception to that rule.\\nDevin Singletary managers lost a walk-in touchdown when Singletary took a knee at the 1-yard line outside the two-minute warning.\\nSticking with Amari Cooper was the right move given he entered the week on pace for 145 targets. But Deshaun Watson is so bad. When you add the sacks, the Browns averaged a pathetic 3.3 yards per pass. Watson should be benched, but I can't see the Browns doing it as Watson's dead cap next year is $172.7 million. Just his cap number next year for 2025 alone is $72.9 million.\\nDerrick Henry did what everyone expected him to do against the Cowboys, who are soft against the run. I don't get the Ravens not wanting to use Henry regularly coming into this week just because teams assumed they'd run when Henry was on the field. Fine. Now you've dictated the defense and should work off that.\\nDallas showed spunk. I do think Dak Prescott is a good QB. But they just can't play with any kind of balance because their defense won't let them. The Dallas defense is 'doomsday' now for its offense. I'm not going to read too much of anything into all the fourth-quarter mad scramble stats.\\nWe're learning a lot about the quarterback position. Sometimes the team can sink the QB and other times the QB can sink the team. It can be hard to tell the difference. We saw evidence of the former with Andy Dalton replacing Bryce Young and the Panthers putting up 437 yards against a Raiders defense that is okay.\\nAs for Dalton, I have few values in life, but a QB throwing for 300 yards with three TDs and no picks being a waiver-wire pickup is definitely one of them.\\nThat Rams comeback against the Niners is a testament to the greatness of their coach Sean McVay and QB Matthew Stafford. It was like Stafford and Kyren Williams were playing with the Week 2 preseason roster. But they somehow created 27 points.\\nOh, 26 touches and three TDs for Williams. No punt returns, BTW. (Xavier Smith won the game with one late.)\\nThis was supposed to be the Brandon Aiyuk 'to the moon' game but that was Jauan Jennings, who was mostly on our benches or on waivers instead. He scored 50 points. Aiyuk scored 9.8. It defies reason.\\nJames Conner had averaged 22.4 points in his past seven games with Kyler Murray, but the Arizona offense had a big bite taken out of it by the Lions. By the way, do you know cats kill 1-to-4 billion birds each year in just the United States? Add one more to that given what the Detroit cats did to the redbirds.\\nIt was a bad day for Jameson Williams managers. He was just not seriously involved in the game plan. It's troubling. He's the prototypical flex10 flex WR because he's so volatile. The Lions clearly want to run the ball 40 times a game. I don't blame them.\\nMalik Willis has been amazing and you have to tip your cap to the coaching staff and play calling. I would have thought his chance of success was about zero given he just arrived in Green Bay and had been awful in Tennessee.\\nIt wasn't just garbage time for Emanuel Wilson. He looked better than Josh Jacobs, it's fair to say. But Jacobs is getting paid so don't worry if you roster him. Jacobs managers have to get Wilson though. I don't even like handcuffs; but this one is a must.\\nGreat day for Zach Charbonnet and who knows when Kenneth Walker will be back with his repeated groin/abdominal injuries. (He's week to week.)\\nCaleb Williams wasn't good in a real way but put up numbers. Baby steps. I consider that very encouraging. Cole Kmet is another monster scorer we wasted because the Bears are so stupid that they mothballed Kmet all summer and the first two games \\u2014 the new OC loves the lifeless corpse of Gerald Everett for some reason. Even with Keenan Allen out, you couldn't count on snaps until you saw them. Now we have, but what a needless waste.\\nYes, Rome Odunze looked good, but remember this Colts pass defense is probably the worst one in the NFL. Would Williams have been better off right now with an offensive lineman in the top 10? Probably. There's also no running game.\\nNo, I'm not apologizing for saying to draft D'Andre Swift at ADP. The Bears made the mistake, not me. I'm not qualified to scout running backs changing teams in March, and I believe the job is the most important thing. They paid for a 60% snap guy and his ADP was 50% tops. Now he looks like the worst running back in football, so clearly Chicago had no vision for the player. Swift had 13 carries, with a long of four yards, incredibly.\\nAnthony Richardson is awful in reality and thus can easily be awful in fantasy against anyone, anytime. Sunday was one of those times. The Colts average a gross 50 plays per game.\\nSam Darnold is the MVP so far with eight TD passes for the unbeaten Vikings, including four on Sunday against Houston. Darnold had a fifth TD called back by an illegal pick which was just poorly executed by Aaron Jones but otherwise legal (he just stood there instead of continuing a 'route').\\nC.J. Stroud is still a young player and just could not deal with the defensive looks Brian Flores was throwing at him. The same thing happened to Brock Purdy in Week 2. I would not worry. But another bad week for Tank Dell is worrisome despite everyone telling you not to worry because they just hate Stefon Diggs (team-high 12 targets) and want Dell to happen SOOOO badly. Dell is a fourth WR in your flex, too, if you play that deep. Nothing more.\\nDid we start Dallas Goedert? Probably not the way we're rolling. He had three catches over 30 yards, which is unreal for a tight end. Only Rob Gronkowski and George Kittle have a game with three of these receptions as a tight end since 2010, according to TruMedia.\\nSaquon Barkley could not look any better right now. His expected value goes up or down about 15% depending on whether the 'Tush Push' is effective. It was not vs. the Saints. It was last week. It should be scrapped, in my opinion.\\nDerek Carr showed us we can never really trust him.\\nI have to give Justin Fields credit for doing what needs to be done. He's not taking as many sacks. He's not hurting the team. He's letting the defense win the game. It helps when the opponent loses its three best offensive players like the Chargers did. Justin Herbert has a high ankle sprain and was in a walking boot, so he probably should not go next week against the Chiefs. Tackles Joe Alt and Rashawn Slater may also be out, and Slater (pec) could be out a while.\",\"rights\":\"nytimes.com\",\"rank\":57,\"topic\":\"business\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Michael Salfino\",\"media\":\"https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2024/09/23001134/Sunday-Fantasy-Football-Takeaways-2.png?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":\"@TheAthletic\",\"_score\":null,\"_id\":\"203697ff24eadb4bed34e110cefcb299\"},{\"title\":\"Lamar Jackson, Ravens thwart Cowboys' late comeback to earn first win: Key takeaways\",\"author\":\"Jeff Zrebiec\",\"published_date\":\"2024-09-22 23:59:46\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5786198/2024/09/22/ravens-cowboys-takeaways-result\",\"clean_url\":\"nytimes.com\",\"excerpt\":\"Jackson threw for a touchdown and rushed for another while relying on veteran running back Derrick Henry.\",\"summary\":\"By Jeff Zrebiec, Jon Machota, Saad Yousuf and Alex Andrejev\\nThe Baltimore Ravens and Lamar Jackson survived a late scare from the Dallas Cowboys to secure their first win of the season Sunday.\\nThe Ravens' two-time MVP quarterback threw for a touchdown and rushed for another while relying on veteran running back Derrick Henry, the four-time Pro Bowler Baltimore signed in March to further ignite their ground game. Henry added two TDs in the win.\\nThe Cowboys lacked the same spark \\u2014 even Tom Brady expressed frustration with Dallas' offense while in the broadcast booth. Although three touchdowns in the fourth quarter kept the game close, Dallas couldn't complete the comeback and dropped to 1-2.\\nRavens prove they have offensive identity\\nAll the talk during the week was about how the Ravens lacked an offensive identity through the first two weeks. Well, they found one Sunday. The Ravens have always been at their best when they are relying heavily on their run game and getting downhill. They made it clear that was their intention and they never really swayed from it.\\nJackson played another strong game, but he was never really asked to do a lot. Baltimore threw the ball just 15 times. The Ravens will need to do more through the air going forward, but with the Cowboys' issues stopping the run, offensive coordinator Todd Monken stuck to the script Sunday. \\u2014 Jeff Zrebiec, Ravens staff writer\\nHow Baltimore rode its big back\\nHenry, who lives in Dallas in the offseason, had interest in signing with the Cowboys in the offseason The Cowboys, though, weren't all that interested. Henry showed the Cowboys what they were missing, rushing for 151 yards and two touchdowns on 25 carries and adding a catch for 23 yards. The Ravens needed every one of those yards to close out the Cowboys. Henry now has four touchdowns in three games with his new team. \\u2014 Zrebiec\\nRavens still have a penalty problem\\nThis is perhaps nitpicky in what was an otherwise dominant win for much of four quarters, but the Ravens still have a penalty problem that they need to figure out. They entered the game ranked 30th in penalties and 31st in penalty yards. They went out against the Cowboys and added 13 more penalties for 105 yards.\\nA few of the offensive penalties contributed to stopping Ravens drives. Some penalties are the cost of doing business, but the Ravens need to cut down on the unnecessary ones. \\u2014 Zrebiec\\nCowboys offense found spark, but not enough\\nIt was a matter of too little, too late for the Cowboys' offense. After sputtering for the better part of the first 50 minutes of the game, Dak Prescott led a fierce rally, aided by an onside kick recovery. The offense was able to march down the field, with Prescott distributing the ball evenly between his targets. There simply wasn't enough time on the clock, though, to rebound from a slew of mistakes early in the game.\\nCeeDee Lamb 's fumble inside the red zone in the first half loomed large, as it wiped out a potential touchdown, but at least a field goal, which proved to be the difference in the game. Tyler Guyton 's holding penalty at the end of the first half also was the potential difference of a touchdown or field goal. The offense left too many plays on the field and asked for a lot from their struggling defense, which couldn't give them the final stop they needed. \\u2014 Saad Yousuf, Cowboys staff writer\\nDefensive woes sink Dallas\\nFor the second consecutive week, the Cowboys lose and it's on the defense. Too many open receivers, too many big runs, too many big plays allowed when the game was still up for grabs. Last week it was Alvin Kamara and Derek Carr looking like one of the best running back/quarterback duos in the league. This week it was Henry and Jackson.\\nDallas' offense did everything it could to get back in the game late. The defense had a chance to finally do its part again. Facing third-and-six with 2:18 to play, Trevon Diggs left too much cushion for Jackson to find Zay Flowers for a first down. After using all their timeouts, the Cowboys still had a chance right after the two-minute warning.\\nBut Jackson again made a play with his feet, getting the final first down needed to run out the clock.\\nWe know there are issues at defensive tackle, but there's plenty of blame to go around on Dallas' defense that reaches beyond just the middle of the defensive front. \\u2014 Jon Machota, Cowboys staff writer\\nRequired reading\",\"rights\":\"nytimes.com\",\"rank\":57,\"topic\":\"business\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Jeff Zrebiec,Jon Machota,The Athletic Staff\",\"media\":\"https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2024/09/22192505/GettyImages-2173798189-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":\"@TheAthletic\",\"_score\":null,\"_id\":\"ef0b32aa9a24949e867a13df181d3a2c\"},{\"title\":\"\\u2018Planning passports' that automatically approve high-quality new homes will be a game-changer, says Keir Starmer\",\"author\":\"Helm\",\"published_date\":\"2024-09-21 21:30:51\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/21/planning-passports-that-automatically-approve-high-quality-new-homes-will-be-a-game-changer-says-keir-starmer\",\"clean_url\":\"theguardian.com\",\"excerpt\":\"Labour wants to see apartment blocks built in more densely populated cities to achieve its housing targets\",\"summary\":\"A radical scheme to speed up the building of more apartment blocks in towns and cities \\u2013 as opposed to individual houses and bungalows \\u2013 has been announced by the prime minister on the eve of the Labour party conference.\\nKeir Starmer told the Observer in an exclusive interview that the new system of 'planning passports' would be a 'game-changer' as the government strives to build 1.5m new homes within five years.\\nUnder the scheme, any proposal that meets high standards for design and quality will be speeded through the planning process with the default decision for planning authorities being 'yes'.\\nAs one of Labour's first acts in government Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, announced the return of compulsory housebuilding targets.\\nAlthough the Conservatives brought in such targets for local authorities in 2019, they watered them down in December 2023 when the then communities secretary Michael Gove published a new National Planning Policy Framework.\\nGovernment sources said the idea was not to build more tower blocks, but rather quality multi-dwelling buildings.

That's a legacy of concessions by the Conservatives to the car lobby. Now it's time to tell drivers that the days of annual freezes are over, and that the UK's car mileage tax needs to be higher to reduce emissions and limit climate change.\\nAnd what a moment for Labour to raise an extra \\u00a31bn a year over the next six months, as well as \\u00a32bn a year from next April that is pencilled into government forecasts but recent history tells us was likely to be cancelled.\\nA weak global economic outlook means oil demand is down, and so are prices at the pumps. If ever motorists were going to be able to carry on driving without feeling the pain of a tax hike, that time is now.\\nSince April, petrol prices have fallen from an average \\u00a31.49 a litre to \\u00a31.36. Diesel costs an average of \\u00a31.40 a litre when five months ago the price was \\u00a31.57.\\nFurther evidence of the good times we are enjoying can be found in the RAC Foundation price tracker, which shows petrol and diesel prices falling from \\u00a31.87 and \\u00a31.96 respectively since the post-pandemic peak in the summer of 2022. If Reeves adds 5p a litre to the cost, motorists will still be 7p a litre better off than they were in April.\\nThe Tory administration had a plan to reverse a 5p emergency cut made in 2022 which was always considered temporary. Reverting to a tax level of 57.95p a litre was supposed to take place next April, which convenient left this tricky decision to the current government.\\nReeves could easily go ahead with that plan, but bring it forward to budget day on 30 October, and in the same breath announce that she is restoring an inflation link to ratchet up fuel duty each year in line with average price increases. Such a move would have the added benefit of helping revive the switch to electric cars, which has stalled this year after playing a big part in new car sales early in the decade.\\nConsumers always consider relative prices, and the declining cost of petrol and diesel will have played a significant role in their decision to delay the jump to electric.\\nData from the Office for Budget Responsibility shows that fuel duty was worth 2% of national income in 2000; 24 years later it is worth just 1%. So while the tax still makes up a large proportion of the cost of petrol at the pump, it has become a smaller slice of average household incomes.\\nThat's not to say it will be an easy sell, especially to businesses affected by transport costs. And oil prices on international markets can jump, which would see motorists facing a double whammy at the pump.\\nThat looks unlikely at the moment. Much of the reason for the drop in oil prices this year lies in China's economic slowdown. Despite having invested in renewables, China remains by far the world's largest consumer of oil, and whenever its economy falters, as it is doing now, oil prices fall.\\nThere is, however, likely to be a backlash from the haulage industry, which is suffering hugely in the post-Brexit era. Higher diesel prices are the last thing owners of big lorries, coaches and industrial equipment want right now, when they are already coping with a shortage of drivers, and rising prices for parts, repairs and replacement vehicles.\\nThe transport industry will say that a combination of taxes and charges will feed through to higher prices in the shops and put them at a disadvantage compared with foreign competition.\\nIt is always difficult to calculate the relative position of transport costs in the round from one country to another. But the fact that inflation is low and heading downwards will offset higher transport prices.\\nThere is also a danger that Reeves will be portrayed as a Scrooge-like figure, scrimping and taxing while much of the nation struggles on meagre rations.\\nShe will need to portray a positive outlook when delivering her budget speech, even though she will feel like a shopkeeper staring into an empty cash register.\\nCar drivers complain about the defunding of local authorities and how it has triggered a dramatic increase in potholes (to such an extent that DIY chains now sell buckets of ready-to-use tarmac for filling said holes).\\nPromising that Labour will do what the Tories only talked about and fix the nation's potholes will go some way to lighten the mood and mitigate the effect of higher fuel tax. Potholes are even more of a problem for electric cars than for their petrol cousins, which gives urgency to a project that is good for the planet.\",\"rights\":\"theguardian.com\",\"rank\":75,\"topic\":\"business\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Phillip Inman\",\"media\":\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/043784088c90ebaaf18ba0787fffec6670caa48c/0_123_3020_1813/master/3020.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4e5825afe211f6391e791cc99ddbbba7\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":\"@phillipinman\",\"_score\":null,\"_id\":\"c205cd004ad21dba4d131ffdb323d3e6\"},{\"title\":\"How tycoons and oligarchs are pushing corporate spies out into the cold\",\"author\":\"Simon Goodley\",\"published_date\":\"2024-09-21 11:00:41\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/21/how-tycoons-and-oligarchs-are-pushing-corporate-spies-out-into-the-cold\",\"clean_url\":\"theguardian.com\",\"excerpt\":\"Business intelligence firms who compile reports on corporate subjects find their targets are fighting back\",\"summary\":\"In John le Carr\\u00e9's landmark espionage novel Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, undersecretary Oliver Lacon \\u00adoutlines the obvious \\u00adproblem in unearthing a traitor at the heart of the British secret service.

Examples have recently included allegations of 'intimidation' and covert surveillance by one operator, Kroll, as it tried to track hedge fund managers betting on falls in the share price of now-disgraced Wirecard; or Lynton Crosby's CT Group, which this year stood accused of unlawfully gathering privileged information in a high court battle over a multibillion-dollar estate linked to a dead Russian billionaire.\\nBoth firms have said they complied with applicable laws and regulations.

Kroll did not respond when asked for the current status of the claim.\\nOther types of scrutiny are also combining to complicate the business of these corporate investigators, whose due diligence reports are routinely commissioned by western companies as they look for comfort when conducting business with unfamiliar entities and tycoons from overseas markets.\\nSometimes these checks may be part of a company's legal responsibilities to ensure they are not breaking any laws \\u2013 yet recent incidents have complicated these efforts and sent shock waves through the industry.\\nFor example, when Chinese authorities raided the Beijing office of Mintz Group last year, the US corporate investigations and due diligence firm had its operations shut down and five of its Chinese staff detained. The company said it was confident neither it nor its employees had done anything wrong.\\nMintz, which lists 12 offices around the world, said it had received no legal notice about the reasons for the raid, but it was later fined about $1.5m for doing 'unapproved statistical work', according to a Beijing Municipal Bureau of Statistics notice.\\nThe effect has been to reduce the already small pool of analysts in China who can conduct due diligence on local companies.\\nNicholas Bortman, a partner at the corporate intelligence firm Raedas, said: 'Companies in the US and Europe sourcing [products and services] from mainland China are facing huge pressure from regulators and national security interests to investigate their supply chains. But the raid on Mintz Group last year cast a chill across the sector.\\n'It's not the first time the Chinese government has taken action against investigators. But the scale and profile of the raid and its impact on Mintz got everyone's attention.'\\nBortman said that the risks now associated with carrying out such work in China were prompting operators to pull back, or at least act with extreme caution, making it harder for western companies to obtain reliable information on the country's markets.\\nHe added: 'In the past, Hong Kong was something of a bridge into the mainland. But the national security law and policy changes in Beijing led to a similar exodus there.\\n'No question, the sector's ability to gather information in China has been degraded. Yet the demand is more acute than ever.'\\nBack in London, there is a separate issue whereby 'spying on the spies' is undermining the industry's ability to conduct due diligence on targets, who may include oligarchs or secretive tycoons.\\nSign up to Observed\\nAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers\\nafter newsletter promotion\\nFor a couple of years now, private investigations firms have been wrestling with frequent requests under the UK's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which allows individuals to gain access to the personal information that companies hold on them.\\nThese demands, known as data subject access requests (DSARs), are being sent to UK corporate intelligence firms by City lawyers representing some of the world's more colourful business figures.\\n'Along with other firms in our sector, we get these ongoing DSARs from representatives of oligarch-type individuals,' said one London-based corporate intelligence boss.\\n'What they are trying to do is to shut down the corporate intelligence companies looking at them and stop us writing anything contentious or controversial in our reports \\u2013 especially if the information comes from human sources of intelligence.'\\nWhile the intelligence firms may resist, stall and redact information they end up supplying in response to these requests, they are under a legal obligation to comply, as the industry does not benefit from the DSAR exemptions that apply to the media.\\nThe only way to counteract this, says the private investigations boss, 'is to say 'bring it on' and fight them every inch of the way. Most don't want to go to court to cleanse their reputation.'\\nHowever, when the oligarch's lawyers see the report on their client, they may follow up with demands for the investigators to stop investigating, delete any report, withdraw any unkind conclusions and promise to never investigate anything to do with their client's business dealings again.\\nThe lawyers might also threaten to sue or pursue anybody they now suspect as the source of any leak.\\nIt is a game that threatens the corporate investigations industry \\u2013 and one that differs only slightly from the ones that Smiley played in le Carr\\u00e9's novels. As the spycatcher said to his rival Karla in Tinker, Tailor: 'We're getting to be old men, and we've both spent our lives looking for the weaknesses in one another's systems.'\",\"rights\":\"theguardian.com\",\"rank\":75,\"topic\":\"business\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Simon Goodley\",\"media\":\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f87476831e88629f268694ce145bac29d1c768c/0_199_1558_934/master/1558.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=acdb96f10f2b5774034c559ee2b87cd0\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":\"@guardian\",\"_score\":null,\"_id\":\"c172752906c821bf6b3dea31213ee816\"},{\"title\":\"Supermarket convenience stores \\u2018charge up to 21% more than their larger branches'\",\"author\":\"Sarah Butler\",\"published_date\":\"2024-09-21 05:00:33\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/21/supermarket-convenience-stores-charge-up-to-21-more-than-their-larger-branches\",\"clean_url\":\"theguardian.com\",\"excerpt\":\"Which? study of 42 popular items such as pasta and milk revealed price difference even greater for loyalty card members\",\"summary\":\"Shopping at a local convenience store can cost you up to a fifth more than buying the same items at larger branches of the supermarket chains who own them, according to a new study \\u2013 with the difference even greater for loyalty scheme members.\\nWhich? compared the cost of 42 popular grocery items \\u2013 from cheese and pasta to blueberries and ice-cream \\u2013 on three occasions in June and July at the largest supermarket-branded convenience chains \\u2013 Morrisons Daily, Sainsbury's Local and Tesco Express \\u2013 against prices at their full-sized supermarkets.\\nThe biggest price difference for the items compared by the consumer group \\u2013 branded and own-label \\u2013 was at Morrisons.

But plaques reminded them not to dance on the tables.\\nThe festival runs through Oct. 6 in 18 large tents covering the Theresienwiese fairground. About 6 million visitors are expected over the festival's 16 days \\u2014 up to 600,000 each day \\u2014 and can expect to shell out between 13.60 and 15.30 euros ($15.12 to $17.01) for a big mug of beer. This year's prices are roughly 3.87% more than in 2023.\\nThis year also includes stepped-up security in the wake of a deadly knife attack in Solingen, a city roughly 470 kilometers (292 miles) northwest of Munich. The violence on Aug. 23 left three people dead and eight more wounded, and the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack, without citing evidence. As a result, organizers added metal detectors to the security procedures for the first time in Oktoberfest's history, but said there were no concrete threats.\\nEarly Saturday, revelers sprinted through the fairgrounds at 9 a.m. as soon as the entrances opened, despite security officers' attempts to keep the procession orderly. They laughed despite the morning chill \\u2014 someone could be heard shrieking 'why are we running!' \\u2014 and raced to get in line again, but this time to be first inside the tents and claim their tables.\\nAdvertisement\\nArticle continues below this ad\\nAfter a traditional parade and Reiter's ceremonial keg-tapping, festivalgoers inside and outside the tents turned their attention to beer and food, with roasted chicken, bratwurst and pretzels being among the most popular. Amusement park rides offered entertainment for young merrymakers who had journeyed to the fairgrounds with their parents.\\nLike many others there on Saturday, Mikael Caselitz, 24, was born and raised in Munich and has attended Oktoberfest for years. He said everyone should travel to the city for the festival at least once in their lives.\\n'It can get really crowded and disgusting when people puke on the side of the road,' he joked, 'but overall it's a really fun experience.'\\nOllie Standen woke up at 6 a.m. to get in line well ahead of the noon keg-tapping. The 21-year-old from England is in Munich this year for a university exchange program and a local friend told him he had to join the festivities. He said he's looking forward to trying different German beers that aren't usually found in the United Kingdom.\\nAdvertisement\\nArticle continues below this ad\\n'It's a great German tradition and I'm excited to be here,' he said.\\nThe event was skipped in 2020 and 2021 as authorities grappled with COVID-19, but returned in 2022.\\nThe first Oktoberfest was held on Oct. 17, 1810 to celebrate the marriage of Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria to Theresa of Saxony.

It was passed during the ensuing caretaker administration.\\nFry, who rose to fame in comedy shows such as \\\"Blackadder\\\" and \\\"Jeeves and Wooster\\\", did not reveal who he was voting for, but mentioned the rising support for the right.\\n\\\"You hear that right-wing forces are growing again in Germany and then wonder whether Austria is also moving in the same direction,\\\" said Fry, who according to his website once joined Britain's centre-left Labour Party. \\\"It's a story that's being watched all over the world.\\\"\",\"rights\":\"reuters.com\",\"rank\":99,\"topic\":\"news\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Dave Graham\",\"media\":\"https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7DKRPQCUNVKIRF7LVNMS5RSTSU.jpg?auth=7c1ef3a0245d8adc990185f4d1ed3d47dfe3007693c3e1dbc6bb2e7633c50e65&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":\"@Reuters\",\"_score\":6.5404153,\"_id\":\"a7b54ff60bd2348f5c0011039af86551\"},{\"title\":\"What to Watch For in a Key German State Election\",\"author\":\"Christopher F.

Trump visited Republicans on Capitol Hill, he hinted at a vision for a vastly different tax system than what the United States has employed for decades.\\nRather than taxing Americans on the money they earn at their jobs and on their investments, Mr. Trump instead suggested imposing a broad tax on the goods that Americans buy from abroad. In his view, such tariffs could replace income taxes as the main source of federal revenue.\\nThe idea, briefly floated behind closed doors, seemed to fizzle, and Mr. Trump did not publicly repeat it as experts questioned whether such a model would even be possible. But in the weeks since, Mr. Trump has floated ideas that, taken together, would fundamentally change the way Americans are taxed, eroding the income tax while embracing expansive tariffs as a way to raise federal revenue.\\nTwo of his proposals \\u2014 no taxes on tips and no taxes on overtime \\u2014 could open gaping loopholes in the income tax, luring Americans of all stripes to change how they earn money to avoid taxes. He has also called for ending taxes on Social Security benefits and fully restoring a costly deduction for state and local taxes \\u2014 all on top of a push to extend tax cuts he signed into law in 2017, many of which expire after next year.\\n'The joke is maybe over the next two weeks he'll get all the way there, and he'll have fully eliminated the income tax with all of his proposals,' said Erica York, an analyst at the Tax Foundation, which generally favors lower taxes.

(Wccftech The move is expected to allow add in board (AIB) partners to clear stock of the now two year old model, but could result in shortages of the highly desirable high-end graphics card in the lead up to Christmas as supplies run dry.\\nNvidia's GeForce RTX 4090\\nDespite it's high price, which still sees most variations from board partners such as Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and Palit rarely dip much below $2,000, The RTX 4090 still sells well making up one percent of the Steam Hardware Survey's count of GPUs, with that count having risen over the last three months and eclipsing that of the RTX 4080. That is likely thanks to the RTX 4080 being discontinued after the RTX 4080 Super launched earlier this year.\\nIn the past Nvidia has opted to launch is recent GPUs between summer and Christmas, though, so unless some other forces are at play that force the company's hand to going with an early 2025 launch instead, a pre Christmas launch would definitely fit with the usual launch windows as well as giving the PC hardware community something else to look forward to in the run up to end of the year.\\nThis would also be a useful coalition of upgrade potential thanks to Intel and AMD launching new processors and motherboards starting from October. AMD will see X870 chipset motherboards hitting shelves that month with its highly anticipated Ryzen 9000X3D CPUs expected around January. Intel meanwhile, as well as releasing its new Lunar Lake mobile CPUs, which impressed at their launch in Germany recently, will also be fully announcing its desktop Arrow Lake-S processors.\\nThese will use a new CPU socket and require DDR5 memory, but it's hoped that Intel can avoid AMD's lacklustre Ryzen 9000 launch, which was marred by delays and disappointing performance as well as Windows fixes. It's an important time of year for all three companies, then, although indications are that AMD will likely not be joining the race for the flagship gaming graphics card crown and will instead be focussing on the mid-range in a similar way to we've seen it do in the past, for example with the RX 5700 XT. This can help to lower costs and afterall, even the mighty RTX 4090 only accounts for one percent of the Steam Hardware Survey GPU count.\\nThe RTX 5000 series will be based on Nvidia's Blackwell architecture using a rumored refined rather than entirely new manufacturing process called N4P. The Blackwell desktop GPU architecture should see a significant boost to transistor count, and could also make the move to PCIe 5 where motherboard support beckons, even if this will not likely see any significant benefits.\\nFor more PC news and reviews including those for AMD, Intel and Nvidia's upcoming launches, don't forget to follow me here on Forbes using the blue button below, on Facebook or my YouTube channel.\",\"rights\":\"forbes.com\",\"rank\":63,\"topic\":\"news\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Senior Contributor,Antony Leather\",\"media\":\"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/63452c0b8adfa2798eaa3149/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1763,992,x255,y345,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":\"@antonyleather\",\"_score\":4.69443,\"_id\":\"7accf11a4625e5850cccb75a2e87e461\"},{\"title\":\"Vladimir Kara-Murza vows to return home to Russia after prisoner swap\",\"author\":\"Laura Kuenssberg\",\"published_date\":\"2024-09-21 16:00:13\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3wp87gpdj1o\",\"clean_url\":\"bbc.com\",\"excerpt\":\"Vladimir Kara-Murza thought he would be executed before the biggest Russia-West prisoner swap since the Cold War began.\",\"summary\":\"A dissident freed by Russia in the biggest prisoner swap since the Cold War has vowed to return to the country one day.Vladimir Kara-Murza told the BBC he initially thought he was being \\\"led out to be executed\\\" when prison officers arrived to get him in Siberia last month.It was only after being moved to Moscow that the dual British-Russian citizen realised he was one of 24 prisoners to be freed in the exchange - including a Kremlin hit man.But in his first joint interview with his wife Evgenia in Europe since they reunited, he defiantly reveals on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that he plans to return to Russia.\\n'When our plane was taking off from Vnukovo airport in Moscow en route to Ankara on 1 August, the FSB [Russian Federal Security Service] officer who was my personal escort sitting next to me turned to me and said, 'Look out the window, this is the last time you're seeing your motherland',\\\" he told me.\\\"And I just laughed in his face, and I said, 'Look, man, I am a historian, I don't just think, I don't just believe, I know that I'll be back home in Russia, and it's going to happen much sooner than you can imagine'.'Mr Kara-Murza, one of the Kremlin's most vocal critics, was held in solitary confinement in a high security jail after receiving a 25-year sentence in April 2023 on charges of high treason.\\n'Thought I was being executed'\\nRecalling the days before the huge Russia-West prisoner swap, he said: 'I was asleep and suddenly the doors to my prison cell burst open and a group of prison officers barged in.\\\"I was woken up, I saw that it was dark, I asked what time it was, they said 3am.

This collaboration aims to simplify and secure the crypto-buying process. Amid these developments, Bitcoin's value surged to $65,000 following a Federal Reserve hint at lowering interest rates but later fell to $60,000.\\nConcurrently, BlockDAG is making significant strides by collaborating with two prominent European soccer clubs and possibly a Premier League club soon, leveraging these partnerships to amplify its growth and build on a successful $73.7 million presale.\\nExpanding PayPal Crypto Payments in the U.S.\\nEarlier this year, PayPal rolled out a feature allowing U.S. users to buy over 110 cryptocurrencies directly through their accounts by collaborating with Miami-based MoonPay. This move underscored PayPal's commitment to more deeply integrate crypto transactions within its services.\\nBy June, this feature was available in Europe and the U.K., broadening the accessibility of PayPal's crypto services and boosting user trust. Ivan Soto-Wright, CEO of MoonPay, highlighted the simplicity and reliability of this service.

These partnerships boost BlockDAG's visibility with eye-catching advertisements and social media buzz during soccer matches.\\nThe buzz doesn't end there. There's talk that BlockDAG might soon partner with a Premier League club. Such a move could stir up excitement in both sports and crypto circles. Leveraging its previous successful partnerships, BlockDAG aims to elevate its presale, which has already gathered $73.7 million from enthusiastic supporters. BlockDAG is clearly in the game to score big, merging the excitement of soccer with the innovative sphere of cryptocurrency.\\nThese partnerships are proving to be a game-changer. BlockDAG connects with the vast, enthusiastic fan bases of these soccer clubs, reaching millions of potential new crypto users. These efforts do more than just increase visibility; they accelerate BlockDAG's expansion across Europe and cement its status as a top pick for crypto traders in 2024.\\nWho's Leading the Next Crypto Wave?\\nAs PayPal extends its crypto services across the U.S. and Europe, and Bitcoin fluctuates in response to Federal Reserve signals, BlockDAG emerges as a standout.

But there is a successor...and it's electric!\",\"summary\":\"After a 17-run the GT-R will go out of production in 2024.\\nAt the time of its launch in 2007, Nissan's GT-R R35 was faster around the famed Nurburgring in Germany than a Porsche 911 Turbo. In a recent sprint from zero to 60-mph by Car and Driver the latest iteration of the GT-R posted a super quick time of 2.9 seconds.\\nWhen BBC Top Gear's former host James May tested the ballistic GT-R around a decade ago, he said it was 'literally, the most amazing car in the world.' His co-host, controversial motoring hack Jeremy Clarkson said of the supercar game-changer, 'They haven't built a new car. Nissan has built a new yardstick!'\\nWell, after a 17-year run, and around ten different updates, the GT-R is finally going out of production with strong rumors that it will be replaced with a totally reinvented 1,300-hp fully electric GT-R. More on that later.\\nThat's right, in October this year, the GT-R R35 will disappear from Nissan's lineup in the U.S. And to celebrate the end of an era, Japan's third biggest carmaker is going out in style by offering hardcore fans access to two special edition models.\\nThe GT-R will go out in style through two special edition models.\\nWith a hand-crafted 565-hp twin turbocharged 3.8-liter V6, four-wheel-drive, four-wheel-steer, 6-piston Brembo brakes, multiple race victories in half a dozen countries, and a launch control from hell, the GT-R is truly a one of a kind.\\nThe new GT-R T-spec celebrates the specially curated editions of the GT-R over the years, while the GT-R T-spec Takumi Edition honors the artisans who put their hearts and souls into every model, hand-building the complex V6 engines. Enthusiasts will appreciate the NISMO carbon-ceramic brakes, fitted as standard, and gold-painted 20-inch NISMO RAYS forged wheels, the NISMO-tuned Vehicle Dynamic Control, and wider front fenders.\\nThe GT-R may not have been a big seller in the U.S., only selling around 13,700 units since 2007, but it's what the Nissan supercar has achieved in racing and movie and gaming culture that makes it so special. The GT-R won the 2015 Blancpain Endurance title in Europe and well as numerous Super GT championships in Japan while it became a hugely popular sports car in the world's biggest selling driving game Gran Turismo in addition to starring in the Fast and Furious movie series.\\nThe GT-R won the 2015 Blancpain Endurance PRO driver's title.\\nJust after it was launched, it quickly became the new standard for super-fast acceleration, handling and cost performance. The Takumi Edition goes for around $151,000 today, but 17 years ago, you could get a new 480-hp GT-R for $69,850. There was no other supercar for that price that offered such power and handling. And now, it's time to shelve the aging supercar.\\nThe curtain may be coming down on the current GT-R, but that doesn't mean the game-changing coupe will vanish completely. Nissan has constantly hinted at a successor, and the big 'aha!' moment came a year ago when the brand unveiled its edgy electric Hyper Force concept at the Tokyo Mobility Show. Boasting the latest solid-state batteries and triple electric motors, the next-gen GT-R is said to generate 1000 kW or 1,341-hp.\\nThe Hyper Force concept shown at last year's Japan Mobility Show.\\nIn a recent interview, Nissan senior vice president Francois Bailly, confirmed the development of a next-generation GT-R R36. A fully electric GT-R, based heavily on the Hyper Force, would enter the lineup as a 'halo car,' showcasing the brand's next-generation EV technology, including game-changing solid-state batteries.\\nA potential launch date however is hard to pin down. Nissan plans to introduce solid-state batteries into production cars in 2028, so an electric GT-R replacement may be at least four years off.\",\"rights\":\"forbes.com\",\"rank\":63,\"topic\":\"news\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Peter Lyon\",\"media\":\"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66f03921d024884c775f9399/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":\"@forbes\",\"_score\":4.2184954,\"_id\":\"cf009fd88eceae17f5f9c09939381389\"},{\"title\":\"Mercedes Also Hit By Weak Sales, China Competition, Faltering EVs\",\"author\":\"Neil Winton\",\"published_date\":\"2024-09-22 12:41:30\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2024/09/22/mercedes-also-hit-by-weak-sales-china-competition-faltering-evs\",\"clean_url\":\"forbes.com\",\"excerpt\":\"Mercedes cut its profit forecast following BMW as German auto makers reel from slowing home sales, China competition and struggling EVs.\",\"summary\":\"Mercedes-Maybach S680 luxury sedan.

Earlier in September BMW slashed its profit forecast to as low as 6% compared with its previous estimate of 8 to 10%.\\nInvestment researcher Jefferies, in a report entitled 'Stormy Weather at Mercedes', said the cut was not unexpected, but the scale of it was.\\nInvestors seemed less irked by BMW's decision because it was linked to a single, quantifiable problem \\u2013 a 1.5 million vehicle recall to fix faulty brakes - but BMW also warned about deteriorating conditions in China.\\nMulti-brand Volkswagen is feeling the pressure and has been forced to consider closing factories for the first time in its 87-year history. VW needs to radically increase its sales of EVs next year or face big fines for offending the European Union's carbon dioxide emissions rules.\\nGlobalData has been relentlessly cutting its sales forecast for Western Europe. Four months ago it was forecasting just under 5% growth. Its latest forecast says there will be a slight contraction with sales falling 0.4% compared with last year, as the total for 2024 peaks out at 11.51 million.\\nAccording to Professor Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research (CAR), German automakers have been asleep at the switch and fallen behind in the development of EVs, their batteries and software. Governments have made the problem worse.\\n'China is increasingly becoming the biggest test of the last 50 years. More than half of new cars in China are electric (it's well under 20% in Europe). Germany and Europe have missed this. Industrial policy in Berlin and Brussels has exacerbated the problem,' Dudenhoeffer said in a statement assessing the Mercedes profit warning after similar action at BMW, and VW's restructuring plan.\\nDudenhoeffer said the Chinese market's huge scale \\u2013 1.3 million EVs will be sold in Europe this year, compared with around 7 million in China \\u2013 means Chinese EV makers have a huge cost advantage.\\n'Politicians in Brussels and Berlin have squandered our home advantage,' Dudenhoeffer said.\\nThe Mercedes-Benz S-class cabriolet. (Photo credit DANIEL ROLAND/AFP via Getty Images)\\nThe Financial Times Lex column said upmarket German automakers are having a bad time in China where an ailing property market has curbed spending on top-of-the-range vehicles like the Mercedes S-Class and Maybach. Prices for the Maybach in Europe start close to $200,000 after tax.\\nLex doesn't see much chance of an economic revival in China.\\n'There's little hope of a real estate revival in China. And the competition in electric vehicles and combustion engine cars may even increase as growth slows. Moreover, if the European Union goes ahead with plans to slap import levies on Chinese EVs, then the higher-end cars that Mercedes ships to China, like the Maybach, could suffer from counter-tariffs. The road ahead looks treacherous,' Lex said.\\nThe same reasoning applies to BMW, and VW's Audi, Porsche, Bentley and Lamborghini subsidiaries.\\nInvestment researcher Bernstein, in a report entitled 'Mercedes - China weakness triggers another profit warning', said Mercedes seemed a bit tentative compared with BMW.\\n'Mercedes was cautious not to provide any updates on 2025 or beyond, simply saying that they would provide an update later in the year. However, this is in stark contrast to BMW, which clearly stated that they expect to return to their strategic margin corridor by 2025,' the report said.\\nDudenhoeffer said German automakers need to take a couple of strategic decisions. They must spend more money on their businesses in China to bridge the costs gap, and seek partnerships to narrow the technology gap.\\n'The only thing that German manufacturers can do is to invest even more in China to build up and expand development centers and production for electric cars. EV technology comes from China now and it has a 'natural competitive advantage. Just as we have natural competitive advantage with the combustion engine.'\\n'Even more cooperation with China, even more cooperation with suppliers and car manufacturers is the only way to make up the lost ground,' Dudenhoeffer said.\",\"rights\":\"forbes.com\",\"rank\":63,\"topic\":\"news\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Neil Winton,Senior Contributor\",\"media\":\"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66ee9ed41fadb39688b831ad/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":\"@wintonsauto\",\"_score\":4.126082,\"_id\":\"6b5f7ae9a2dd66a75f60ee024c48f70b\"},{\"title\":\"Travel isn't just fun.

The display can go a little dimmer and a little brighter as required. The A18 Pro chipset runs faster than the iPhone 15 Pro's A17 Pro, which was already enough to cope with most of the phone's demands. Apple has increased the memory with a view to supporting new AI tools, and the battery life when watching videos has increased.\\nAll of these are larger and more welcoming than twelve months ago, but none feel like progress. Instead, Apple has kept pace with wider industry trends, and as the only manufacturer of iPhones, those looking for something a bit better have no choice but to buy the iterative update.\\nBut there's one area where Apple has innovated hard.\\niPhones 16 Pro models are on display in the Apple store in Germany.(Photo by Elisa Schu/picture ...

The Action Button is now available over all four iPhone 16 models, and a second capacitive button has been added. The Camera Control button acts as a shutter button, but thanks to its capacitive nature, it can offer a multitude of functions, all accessible under a single finger.\\nThis includes controls for exposure and depth of field, along with photo filters, zoom, and switching between photo and video modes. There's no doubt that the camera control button is a welcome addition to the interface. Forbes contributor David Phelan picks out this one change as a game-changer for the shutterbugs:\\n\\\"There's a learning curve here, but it's shallow and easily managed.

CLARY/AFP via Getty Images)\\nThere is, of course, one elephant in the smartphone room that is revolutionising the space. The use of generative artificial intelligence.\\nThe iPhone 16 family has been heralded as the first to be built for Apple Intelligence. The use of generative AI in smartphones burst into the public consciousness with the Google Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro in October 2023, and the second generation of the software launched in August 2024.\\nSince then, Apple's generative AI system\\u2014the clunkily backronymed Apple Intelligence\\u2014has been presented to the press twice by Apple, first at June's Worldwide Developer Conference and then at the launch of the iPhone 16 family itself. Yet, it is still not available for public release.\\nThe first hints of generative AI will be added to iOS in the v18.1 update due in October, with the addition of the iconic ChatGPT not happening until December, and the core functionality, as seen across the Android platform, may arrive by March 2025.\\nThe most significant innovation in the smartphone space will not be available to iPhone users until Spring next year. In that same window, the majority of Android users will have seen not only the full suite of first-generation generative AI but will have received the updated second-generation software.\\nEven with the most generous reading of the 'Apple is not first, but Apple is the best' mythic storytelling, Apple has missed the boat on AI and is struggling to catch up.\\nPeople seen testing their new iPhones during the launching of the new iPhone 16 and 16 Pro (Photo by ...

Researchers from the behaviour and health research unit at the University of Cambridge (heard of it?!) have recommended that the traditional British pint be abandoned in favour of the two-thirds measure.\\nAfter a trial in a dozen pubs, bars and restaurants in England, the study leader, Prof Theresa Marteau, concluded that the change \\u2013 which led to nearly 10% less beer being sold and consumed \\u2013 could reduce the impact of alcohol-related harm.\\nI'm entirely in favour of the idea, but only partly because of the potential benefits to population health. Ever since I moved to the UK in 2017, I've felt that the British pint is simply too big to comfortably enjoy. Even if you sip slowly, by the time you reach the bottom, you're inevitably left feeling sluggish and bloated because of the vast quantity of liquid you've consumed.\\nIt's unwieldy to transport from the bar to the table and the final third is always warm, even if it wasn't served that way to start with. Then, if you're locked into a round, you're obliged to do it all over again.\\nIt's no wonder Britain has a problem with alcohol: every time you agree to a quick pint \\u2013 which, let's be honest, normally ends up as at least two \\u2013 you're committing yourself to imbibing more than a litre of the stuff.\\nOf course, you could always get a half, as one friend suggests. She recently switched to that as her standard order, and claims it's a gamechanger for painlessly moderating your alcohol intake. But I can't help but feel short-changed, handing over three quid for a drink that can be downed in two-and-a-half swigs, leaving you to wait for your companion to finish their monster pint.\\nThe two-thirds pint is the perfect compromise: enough beer to feel you've got your money's worth, and can relax into the experience \\u2013 but not so much that it leaves no room in your stomach for anything else.\\nI developed a preference for the two-thirds pour while living in Sydney, where the 'schooner' is standard. I certainly wouldn't say that Australia has a more civilised drinking culture than Britain, or less alcohol-related harm: the sheer range of measures available (a schooner, a pot, a middy, a handle, a glass; some differing by state) speaks to beer's central importance.\\nBut the widespread acceptance of smaller serves, in my experience, made for a better time at the pub. Coming in at a touch over two-thirds of a pint, I found that the standard 425ml schooner is the perfect volume of liquid for catching up with a friend, and creating a break from your day but not sending it off track. Even if you do go in for a second, you've still had less than one litre of beer.\\nReally, when you think about it, 568ml is an obscene amount of liquid to consume in one sitting \\u2013 and 1,136ml even more so. It probably wouldn't occur to you to drink more than half a litre of coffee, or milkshake, or kombucha at a time. So why is it the norm, in Britain, with beer \\u2013 and despite the known harms?\\nI know that I've looked askance at teenagers chugging from those bucket-sized cans of energy drinks and wondered what all that guarana must be doing to their systems. But with alcohol, we know only too well that it's nothing good. Even drinking in moderation isn't as harmless as we've been led to believe, with many of those findings reached by flawed methodology, and sometimes with funding from the alcohol industry.\\nYou could argue, given the increasingly damning research, that reducing the standard measure by a third isn't going far enough: we should be abstaining from alcohol entirely. I don't foresee Britain ever becoming teetotal \\u2013 but that doesn't mean there aren't changes that could be made, to reduce the harms of alcohol without encroaching on the pleasures.\\nAt the Bear pub in Sheffield, which participated in the Cambridge study, punters generally stuck to two drinks rather than making up the difference with a third, suggesting it's the two-drink ritual that is important to British drinkers rather than the size of the glass. The experiment suggests that, with a relatively straightforward tweak, we can still enjoy the ritual of alcohol while avoiding some of the adverse effects.\\nThe British pint is one of the largest standard servings in the world \\u2013 bigger than those in Australia, Germany and the US. It has been that way since 1698, when a law was passed to prevent publicans from short-changing their customers with shorter measures. But now we know that more is not always better \\u2013 especially in the case of alcohol. We might not be willing to give up drinking entirely, but certainly in Australia I was happy to settle for less.\\nElle Hunt is a freelance journalist\",\"rights\":\"theguardian.com\",\"rank\":75,\"topic\":\"news\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Elle Hunt\",\"media\":\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5aa6f46b0c5d4adbfe0584709362d58dc6024577/0_166_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a72d0963ccfd5377f87f67a92bea02b5\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":\"@guardian\",\"_score\":4.113441,\"_id\":\"5a10d0c700f9f742ff230123a97ca3b6\"},{\"title\":\"Tiny rainforest lizards leap into water and don't come up when expected.

At a private meeting with members of the European parliament in Strasbourg last Tuesday, she chose not to reveal who would get what job in her incoming European Commission, due to take office at the end of the year.\\nThen immediately afterwards, during a brisk 21-minute press conference, she announced every single name, leaving MEPs fuming. 'That's not how it should be done,' said one.\\nThe secrecy around the big reveal is characteristic of von der Leyen, who carefully controls the flow of information. Named as the most powerful woman in the world by Forbes magazine and soon to start a second term as commission president, she has organised her new team in a way that is a lesson in how to amass control.\\n'This is very like the divide and rule approach,' said Sophia Russack, a researcher at the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels.\\nEU watchers have been poring over organisational charts of the new commission, drawing in lines of who reports to who. The answer is soon clear: all power flows to von der Leyen.\\nThe 'presidentialisation' of the commission has been under way since the EU's 'big bang' enlargement in 2004 made the EU executive's top table far bigger, creating a need for more direction. Each of the 27 member states has a commissioner, a privilege none wants to give up. But von der Leyen has taken presidential power to another level.\\nLast week, she oversaw the departure of one of her sharpest critics: French commissioner Thierry Breton, who had expected to return to Brussels for a second term after being nominated by France's president, Emmanuel Macron. Instead, after back channel talks between Macron and von der Leyen, Breton was out. He resigned, accusing her of 'questionable governance'.\\nIn another show of strength, von der Leyen arm-twisted governments to send her female commissioner candidates, rewarding countries that complied (including Romania and Slovenia) with big jobs or impressive-sounding titles.\\nGovernments that snubbed her request to suggest women (Austria, Ireland) found themselves without the 'big economic portfolio' they had sought, albeit gaining weighty jobs.\\nIn 2019, von der Leyen was a surprise last-minute choice to lead the commission. She took office weeks before the Covid pandemic tipped Europe into unprecedented crisis. During lockdown, working with a small team in the commission's HQ, where she also lives \\u2013 von der Leyen has a windowless converted washroom on the 13th floor \\u2013 reinforced her penchant for taking decisions alone.\\n'The question now for the next term is whether she can do normal,' Russack said. During von der Leyen's first term, she added, 'her team operated like a commando hub in a crisis and that worked so well. I wonder if she is able to wield her power in the same way when she doesn't have the excuse of an emergency.'\\nSign up to Observed\\nAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers\\nafter newsletter promotion\\nThe tasks in her in-tray are daunting: the brutal war in Ukraine and the spectre of Donald Trump in the White House. The EU is off-track with targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, while struggling to switch to a green economy in the face of heavily subsidised competition from China and the US.\\nEarlier this month, the former president of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi said the EU must embrace deep reforms and spend \\u20ac800bn (\\u00a3670bn) a year to avert 'a slow and agonising decline'.\\nFew expect EU leaders to agree on Draghi's ambitious agenda. In France, Macron is weakened after snap elections created a prolonged political stalemate. Germany's chancellor, Olaf Scholz, presides over a squabbling three-way coalition that is preoccupied with domestic politics after unprecedented victories for the far right in regional elections, with another defeat on the horizon on Sunday in Brandenburg.\\nOne senior EU official cautioned against the idea that von der Leyen could step into a leadership vacuum. 'You are only as strong as the weakest link in the [European] council.'\\nTo get legislation passed, von der Leyen needs not only EU member states, but also the European parliament, which has more far-right MEPs hostile to the EU than ever before. 'On legislation, she will have a lot of trouble,' said the senior official. 'You are no longer talking about 30 nutcases. You are now talking about 150 people who are not well intentioned.'\\nThe big tent coalition of pro-EU parties that supported von der Leyen \\u2013 from her own centre-right European People's party, the socialists, centrists and greens \\u2013 will be tested. 'She will be much more vulnerable and prone to shifts in majority,' the official added.\\nVon der Leyen's new commission is likely to take office around 1 December. These few months before the fray may be the peak of her powers.\",\"rights\":\"theguardian.com\",\"rank\":75,\"topic\":\"news\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Jennifer Rankin\",\"media\":\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6b17b9d8464e567192f7e8b4796e680917b5dc4/38_209_3633_2180/master/3633.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7dbb98c1b3b7fd829ba75ef5f07fde50\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":\"@guardian\",\"_score\":3.9359336,\"_id\":\"5712a7eeb8ffd3b48957805b2612d2fd\"},{\"title\":\"REJO Solidifies Its Global Footprint with a Prominent Presence at InterTabac 2024\",\"author\":\"Rejo\",\"published_date\":\"2024-09-22 02:13:10\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/rejo-solidifies-its-global-footprint-with-a-prominent-presence-at-intertabac-2024-09a963299100ee0a8576d2c3d6170ca1\",\"clean_url\":\"apnews.com\",\"excerpt\":\"REJO Unveils Innovative Heating Devices REJO AF1 and REJO Mate Air Announces Global Expansion Plans at InterTabac 2024 Signing of MOU with a major partner from Czech Republic\",\"summary\":\"REJO Unveils Innovative Heating Devices REJO AF1 and REJO Mate Air\\nAnnounces Global Expansion Plans at InterTabac 2024\\nSigning of MOU with a major partner from Czech Republic\\nDORTMUND, Germany, Sept. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- REJO, a pioneering brand in heat-not-burn (HNB) tobacco industry, made a significant impact at this year's InterTabac event, further solidifying its position as a pioneering global provider in innovative tobacco solutions.\\nAs the world's leading event for tobacco industry, InterTabac serves as a key platform for industry players to showcase their latest products and technologies.

They secured a 174-seat landslide majority little more than two months ago, but the words being used to describe the atmosphere are not like they were 27 years ago. Some characterise it as surreal; others are more despairing that a series of 'unforced errors' have robbed Keir Starmer and his team of their political honeymoon.\\n'What should have been a victory parade, and the height of the administration's powers, has already stalled,' said one MP. 'Hardly the most auspicious of starts for the next five years.'\\nGripes over Starmer's odd predilection for free trips and trousers \\u2013 a habit now jettisoned in the wake of stories about the freebies he, his wife and his top team have taken \\u2013 have collided with complaints about the power and pay of his chief of staff, Sue Gray. The complaints are gnawing away at the prime minister's self-styled reputation as the person to clean up politics after years of Tory sleaze.\\n'It's just further confirmation of how politically naive Starmer is,' said an MP. 'I have no doubt whatsoever that people like [New Labour architect Peter] Mandelson understand this and would probably have advised him not to go down the 'white knight in anti-sleaze armour' route.'\\nYet there is a suspicion that these complaints have been driven by a bigger question that many MPs hope Starmer will begin to answer this week on Merseyside: having secured power, what is it actually for?\\nFor many, the rows over freebies and the pay of his team are a symptom of the fact that he has not yet articulated a political narrative big enough to fill the vacuum.\\nIt wasn't meant to be this way. Labour aides have been telling people that there will be record numbers at conference this year, with about 20,000 people, delegates and others, descending on Liverpool. For months, Starmer's officials had been planning how to strike the balance between celebration and getting on with the job of mending the country after 14 years of the Tories.\\n'I don't think it's very happy in there,' said one insider, referring to Downing Street. '[Starmer] will be being pushed to lean into something more positive.' There are plans to make clear all the things that the government has already achieved in its short time in office \\u2013 a manoeuvre also used by the party in 1997. But the sense that the prime minister needs to set a stronger sense of direction will be underlined by the worrying polling data now emerging.\\nFollowing the complaints about freebies, the latest Opinium polling for the Observer shows cause for concern. Apart from a staggering fall in Starmer's personal approval ratings \\u2013 down 45 points since July \\u2013 Labour has declined on other polling measures. It has fallen 17 points when voters are asked if Labour has 'similar views to my own'; 20 points on whether it has 'the nation's best interests at heart', and 29 points on whether it is 'in touch with ordinary people'.\\nFor some, this is the inevitable noise that comes with taking power at such a difficult moment for the public finances, with a tax-raising budget on the horizon. Others, however, see it as an early warning that Labour's support in the country started at a low base, despite the huge win, and that a stronger sense of direction is needed.\\nHowever, it is a pressure Starmer understands. 'We had to make it clear what the inheritance was,' he says in his interview this week with the Observer. 'But I think \\u2026 we do need to say why, and explain and set out and describe the better Britain that this ladders up to, if we get the original decisions right.'\\nThe problem for Starmer this week is that if he fails to take a strong lead in showing his government's next steps, there are a few powerful figures in the union movement itching to give him a shove in a direction of their choosing. While the major Labour-affiliated unions have been incredibly obedient both during the election campaign and in the new government's early months \\u2013 kept onside with the promise of a workers' rights overhaul and the end of anti-strike legislation \\u2013 some, such as Unite, are now beginning to campaign in earnest against Labour's cut to winter fuel payments for most pensioners.\\nIt is also working with others on a major conference confrontation on austerity. Its motion will condemn the winter fuel payment policy and call for a U-turn, and demand a wealth tax on top earners and changes to the fiscal rules to allow more borrowing and investment. Union sources said they were confident it would reach a vote in some form on Monday.\\nEven allies of Starmer have become critical of what they fear is the 'Osborne playbook' being deployed by the Treasury team. Much more important to them is prioritising the missions Starmer set out before the election, aimed at restoring the NHS, boosting economic growth and pursuing clean power.\\nThe left of the party is diminished, but some of its senior figures are setting out a narrative that chimes with a wider audience. John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor who was suspended from the party for voting against the government on an amendment calling on it to scrap the two-child limit on benefits, is among them. He believes that without more optimism and ambition from Labour, the beneficiary will be Nigel Farage and Reform UK.\\n'It's one of the shortest honeymoons I've ever seen in politics,' he said. 'It was a toxic inheritance and people understand that. People want us to say how bad it is, of course, but then tell us how we're going to get through it \\u2013 give us a bit of hope.\\n'I was worried that if we didn't deliver by midterm, people would become disillusioned and it would be the far right that benefits from it, as we've seen in France and Germany. If we're threatened with an austerity budget, it just feeds Reform and Farage and all the rest. That's my worry.'\\nAn MP still inside the parliamentary fold agrees. 'Reform thrives in chaos,' they said.\",\"rights\":\"theguardian.com\",\"rank\":75,\"topic\":\"sport\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Michael Savage\",\"media\":\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d412d1888f0df1e4c53512a9e3692a4e5698e49/0_0_4593_2756/master/4593.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fe2e735056ba05ab2412181b3c471947\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":\"@guardian\",\"_score\":3.7747855,\"_id\":\"a648f06eaf878bc440b12ccf3717ceaa\"},{\"title\":\"Wildlife biologist Diane Boyd: \\u2018Wolf and human societies have intriguing parallels'\",\"author\":\"Zo\\u00eb Corbyn\",\"published_date\":\"2024-09-21 15:00:43\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/sep/21/wildlife-biologist-diane-boyd-grey-wolf\",\"clean_url\":\"theguardian.com\",\"excerpt\":\"The grey wolf expert on the incredible distances the predators travel, why dogs are a kind of dumbed down wolf \\u2013 and her most hair\\u2011raising close call\",\"summary\":\"The grey wolf (Canis lupus) has generated fear and hatred. Seen as a danger to livestock and people, the once widespread predator was nearly completely eradicated from western Europe and most of the contiguous US in the 19th and 20th centuries. Pro- and anti-wolf groups now duel over how the species should be managed as populations have rebounded in places over the past few decades. American wildlife biologist Diane Boyd, 69, has spent 40 years studying the recovery of wild wolf populations in remote north-western Montana and Glacier national park. When she started in the late 1970s on the University of Montana's Wolf Ecology Project (WEP) \\u2013 which she later co-led \\u2013 she was the only female biologist in the US trapping, radio-collaring and following their trails through the snow for research. Boyd's new memoir, A Woman Among Wolves, charts her life's work with the animals and looks at the challenges of wolf management across the world today.\\nWhat is it about wolves that drew you in?I grew up in Minnesota, the only state in the lower 48, along with a tiny part of Michigan, where wolves hadn't been completely extirpated. They were denizens of the wilderness that nobody saw and that fascinated me. They are clever, beautiful and interesting animals. The parallels between wolf and human society are intriguing \\u2013 like us, they are social, live in family groups and defend their homes. I have also always been a dog person: a dog is kind of a dumbed down version of a wolf.\\nThe successful reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone national park and central Idaho in 1995 is celebrated as a great wildlife conservation achievement. But what is the untold story?That wolf recovery has been natural, too. Americans, along with the rest of the world, tend to think of wolves as all reintroduced and that reintroduction is the only way they become re-established: that is wrong. About 15 years prior to the Yellowstone and Idaho reintroductions, and just a few years after they had received federal endangered species status [granted in 1974], they walked down from Canada into north-western Montana and Glacier national park without any help or fanfare. And they began to filter out. The approximately 3,000 wild wolves in the western US today are, in part, because of that natural recolonisation.\\nIs reintroduction worthwhile, or should we let wolves just return naturally?It is complicated. The advantage of reintroduction is it jump starts the process. The disadvantage is that wolves that are reintroduced can be resented by people: they're not seen as native or natural any more, which leads to potentially less tolerance and therefore longevity for them.\\nAn amazing piece of the wolf recovery puzzle is how, enabled by legal protection, wolves have so successfully recolonised western Europe on their own (nowhere in Europe has there been any reintroductions), squeezing into human-dominated landscapes and surviving. Germany, Denmark and even the heavily farmed Netherlands have all become home.\\nHow would a typical year studying the wolves unfold?Summer was trapping and radio-collaring. It is your classic, ugly, cold, steel foothold trap and it holds the animal against their will by their paw. The chance of success is low but you persist. I rebuilt the traps with modified parts to make them more humane and selective for wolves and we checked them often to minimise the time an animal was held. To fit the radio-collar, we would first tranquilise the wolf \\u2013 I had a custom-made jab stick \\u2013 and then wait nearby until it woke up.\\nWinter was tracking our animals with radio telemetry gear \\u2013 both from the air (we hired a plane and skilled pilot) and from the ground on skis or snowmobiles. Following a wolf's tracks in the snow is like reading a story. You can see where they stopped to sniff and pee, where they chased an animal and you learn their travel routes. We would also investigate wolf kills \\u2013 skiing in after they left to determine what they had taken and its condition.\\nIn spring, wolves den and we didn't bug them.\\nYou've had some hair-raising encounters with all sorts of wild animals. Have you ever been bitten?I came close with an adolescent wolf we named Ice. We caught her on a cold rainy day and she was hypothermic. We drugged her and a colleague and I lay her on our laps in the front seat of our truck with the heater and our bodies trying to warm her up. As her temperature normalised, I turned the heater down and, though the rest of her was completely still, her ear swivelled in the direction of the click. I thought: 'Oh my God, this wolf is fully awake.' I indicated silently to another colleague outside the truck to open the door. What happened next was a whirlwind: she leapt to her feet on top us. I grabbed her by the scruff and directed her snout away as she bit at the steering wheel and the air. My colleague pushed her rump and I fell out of the truck hanging on to her. We landed; she jumped up and ran away. All in the day of a life of a wolf biologist!\\nThe Wolf Ecology Project ran over 15 years until 1995. What did it reveal about wolves that was new?One of our most surprising findings, which hadn't been documented before \\u2013 there weren't GPS collars then \\u2013 was the distance wolves can travel: easily hundreds of miles within months. We would often get radio-collars returned from animals that had been shot huge distances away from their last signal or there would be a faraway sighting of a collared wolf. Our longest dispersal, Wolf 8551, was killed having travelled a straight-line distance of 540 miles north into Canada.\\nWhat does the future hold for wolves in the US and beyond? The species has been delisted as endangered in parts of the west \\u2013 Montana, Idaho and Wyoming \\u2013 and state-managed hunting outside of national parks is now allowed there. Meanwhile, the EU is undertaking a review of wolves conservation status after growing complaints from farmers whose livestock has become prey.Those US states are required to maintain a population of 150 animals, but no more. And the new hunting laws they have adopted in the past few years are horribly archaic and torturous \\u2013 allowing for wolves to be taken by virtually any method. In Europe, wolves have been well tolerated, but that has its limits. Wolves are resilient but ultimately their fate is up to us: they exist in the landscape at our whim. I hope we continue to protect them in enough areas that they will always be here.\\nA Woman Among Wolves by Diane K Boyd is published by Greystone (\\u00a318.99).

'Our agreements with President Biden are being implemented,' he said. 'And they are being implemented very accurately \\u2013 ATACMS have proven themselves.' By that point the missiles had, according to US officials, already been used in several strikes on Russian-occupied Luhansk and the southern coastal town of Berdiansk.\\nA few months earlier, a similar story played out with the British Storm Shadows when then-Defence Secretary Ben Wallace only confirmed they had been supplied once they were already in use. In both cases, Ukraine promised not to use them on Russian territory.\\nThis September, Zelensky is employing a strategy of more openly challenging his allies, and that, combined with Russia's open threats that any lifting of restrictions on their use would mean war with NATO, has turned the issue of firing these missiles into Russia into a political touchstone, an ultimate determinant of the extent of Western support.\\nZelensky has refused to allow the topic to fall out of the headlines - publicly criticizing his allies' hesitation after a Russian strike on a military educational facility in Poltava killed more than 50 people earlier this month.\\n'Every day of delay is, unfortunately, the death of people,' he said.\\nLast weekend, after a Russian bomb attack on an apartment block in Kharkiv, he even made veiled accusations of cowardice, saying: 'This terror can be stopped. But to stop it, the fear of making strong, objectively necessary decisions must be overcome.'\\n'Zelensky has taken a bit of a risk on this,' said Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank in London. 'He's almost playing political chicken. He's kind of daring people to support him.' If it happens though, the political dividend would be significant, says Savill, blunting Russian rhetoric and 'demonstrating firm international support' for Ukraine.\\nAs for the battlefield dividend, that, experts say, is less clear cut.\\nOpinion is divided on the extent to which the public debate around the missile permissions has blunted their potential utility - especially when it comes to targeting Russian fighter jets and missiles before they can be used against Ukraine's civilian infrastructure. US intelligence believes 90% of Russian aircraft that launch deadly glide bombs (at least 100 per day, according to Zelensky), are more than 300 kilometers (186 miles) from Ukrainian-controlled territory, so outside of ATACMS range. And that number may be increasing. Russia recently relocated planes from two bases near the border further east, according to one US official.\\nSavill agrees 'lots of the juiciest targets' have likely been moved deeper into Russian territory, meaning the impact on the war may be 'limited.' But that doesn't mean the missiles have no utility. Storm Shadows, designed to penetrate deep into concrete, could be effective against military headquarters, or ammunition stores, many of which are still in range. ATACMS, some of which have cluster warheads, could be used to do significant damage to airfields. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a think-tank in Washington DC, has calculated that 15 Russian airfields are in range of ATACMs (though it's not clear how many aircraft are still housed on them).\\nGeorge Barros, the author of that ISW research, agrees a less public debate may have been preferable, but if the very prospect of these permissions being granted has forced Russia to move aircraft further from the border, it's a good thing. It could reduce the number of bombing missions Russian planes can make (known in the military as the 'sortie rate') and buy Ukraine valuable detection and reaction time for incoming attacks.\\nMore importantly, he believes that if Ukraine could strike Russian troops, weaponry and logistics within the 300-kilometer range of the top-end ATACMS, it would for the first time force Russia to calculate the risks of moving large amounts of troops and equipment into Ukraine.\\n'You've only just now \\u2026 started talking about a potential risk to Russia's rear area and depriving them of this insane luxury that the Russian command has leveraged. To really bring mass (equipment), to get 10 to one artillery ratios on Ukraine at the frontline,' he told CNN.\\nBarros' research has pinpointed at least 200 potential targets that would be in range of ATACMs, ranging from military regiments to fuel depots, weapons storage depots, and even the headquarters of Russia's Southern Military district in Rostov (all of which would be much harder to move than aircraft).\\nThe list is also conservative, Barros acknowledges, and has not accounted for new targets installed after the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. And some of the newest targets of all could, according to Savill, include Iranian FATH-360 ballistic missiles, which the US believes have already been supplied and have a range of just 75 kilometers (47 miles), far less than the Western missiles.\\nExperts also agree the missiles could provide valuable support to Ukraine's drone and ground operations. Savill believes ATACMS could do serious damage to Russian air defense radars and systems, adding that 'if you punch a hole through, actually Ukrainian long-range drones have got better options to penetrate deeper into Russia.' Hitting Russian air defense systems in the border areas could also improve Ukraine's chances of retaking its own territory, said Barros.\\n'You actually do open up some interesting areas where there's parts of occupying Ukraine that are no longer under Russia's air defense umbrella,' he said.\\nThere's also the option in theory, Savill said, to extend the range of the missiles by launching from Ukrainian positions inside Kursk, though that could put Ukrainian bombers and missile launchers in the crosshairs of Russian air defenses.\\nUltimately, Ukraine continues to argue that the ability to use Western-supplied long-range missiles inside Russia is part of the complex jigsaw puzzle of ending this war on Kyiv's terms \\u2014 and a way to show Russia it cannot outlast Ukraine's allies.\\nZelensky is heading to the US on the one hand buoyed by the Kursk offensive providing fresh evidence of both Ukrainian ingenuity and, he argues, the flimsiness of Russian 'red lines,' but on the other hand motivated by the prospect of a third winter with critical electricity shortages, and still inadequate supplies of equipment and manpower.\\n'We need to have this long-range capability not only on the occupied territory of Ukraine, but also on Russian territory,' he told a large gathering of Ukraine's allies at the US' Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany earlier this month, 'so Russia is motivated to seek peace.'\",\"rights\":\"cnn.com\",\"rank\":78,\"topic\":\"news\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"CNN,Clare Sebastian\",\"media\":\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2160862452.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":\"@CNN\",\"_score\":3.3855896,\"_id\":\"f5ee60cf2f0263731d4905e1529389e7\"},{\"title\":\"Shep the dog to a WW2 pigeon: Eight strange and poignant images of pet cemeteries\",\"author\":\"\",\"published_date\":\"2024-09-22 10:14:02\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20240919-eight-strange-and-poignant-images-of-pet-cemeteries\",\"clean_url\":\"bbc.com\",\"excerpt\":\"A new photography book explores the practice of memorialising beloved beasts, from a performing elephant in Las Vegas to service animals and the world's most loyal sheepdog.\",\"summary\":\"A new photography book explores the practice of memorialising beloved beasts, from a performing elephant in Las Vegas to service animals and the world's most loyal sheepdog.\\nThe first time Paul Koudounaris visited Pet Haven Cemetery and Crematory in Gardena, California, the US author, photographer and expert in macabre art history was surprised to find his eyes wet with tears. \\\"After writing three books about death, and not being affected by anything, five hours with those little graves had finally broken me,\\\" he tells the BBC. \\\"The sentiment there had become overwhelming.\\\"\\nFaithful Unto Death \\u2013 Pet cemeteries, animal graves and eternal devotion, published by Thames & Hudson this month, is the culmination of Koudounaris's 11-year exploration of the cultural practice of memorialising animals, from hand-painted pet portraits lit by lanterns in a forested Helsinki graveyard to extravagant mausolea in New York and Boston made of granite and bronze.\\nThe grave markers Koudounaris discovers commemorate a whole ark of animals. Beneath some lie great behemoths, such as Stoney the elephant, a regular performer at the Luxor Hotel, Las Vegas in the 1990s. Others pay homage to smaller companions: Jonny the snail, for example, befriended by a man whose garden he frequented in Echo Park, Los Angeles. \\\"It just goes to show that people can bond with any kind of animal,\\\" Koudounaris says.\\n1. The first urban cemetery\\nHumans have paid homage to companion animals for millennia. The ancient Egyptians built animal necropoli, mummifying their non-human friends so they might join them in the afterlife. But the pet cemetery as we now know it, says Koudounaris, began in England and was born of the Industrial Revolution. \\\"In the 19th Century, for the first time, more people are living in urban environments than rural environments, bringing this taste for animal ownership with them,\\\" he explains. Cremation was opposed by the Church, and a stigma \\u2212 that persists today \\u2212 forbade the burial of animals in human cemeteries. The first urban cemetery for animals, founded in 1881 in Hyde Park, London, answered the question of how to dispose of a swelling pet population in a location where private land was rare.\\n2. Service animals\\nThe continent took up the trend in 1899 when Paris, tired of its citizens throwing dead dogs into the Seine, opened the swirling Art Nouveau gates of the Cimeti\\u00e8re des Chiens. As a new century dawned, the concept gradually went global. Today, the biggest adoptees are the Americans, with canine battle heroes acknowledged as far afield as Guam, Micronesia. Service animals are \\\"the most esteemed\\\", and their graves \\\"always the best tended\\\", says Koudounaris. One such grave, this time in Ilford Animal Cemetery in East London, commemorates Mary of Exeter, a pigeon who served in World War Two by carrying messages across the English Channel, a route that just one in 10 birds would survive. She was ambushed by Germany's specially trained birds of prey and riddled with shotgun pellets, but Mary \\u2212 sewn up and fitted with a neck brace \\u2212 performed mission after mission, surviving against the odds.\\n3. The taboo of bereavement\\nAt Wat Khlong Toei Nai, a Buddhist temple in Bangkok, owners can decorate their deceased pets with flowers and then take a boat ride to release their cremated remains into the river. \\\"One of the things that we're missing in Western culture is a ritual that provides closure,\\\" says Koudounaris, who, in his work as pet grief counsellor, found many people feeling guilty or embarrassed about the length and depth of their bereavement. \\\"I think that's why it's a lot easier if you're in a culture that believes in the reincarnation, the transference of the soul, to not have that kind of hierarchy, to not have that kind of taboo,\\\" he says. \\\"Because you might come back as a butterfly, a cat or a human\\u2026 there's not that stratification.\\\"\\n4. Shep the dog\\nSometimes the story is not about an owner mourning a pet, but a pet mourning an owner. So it was with Shep, a Shepherd-Collie mix who, for six years, waited expectantly at the platform of Fort Benton railroad station in Montana, hoping his late owner, whose casket had been loaded onto an eastbound train in 1936, would one day return. The devoted dog became a local celebrity but refused the hospitality of well-meaning residents, preferring to keep up his vigil at the station. In 1942, deaf and infirm, he slipped into the path of a train. To assuage their grief and memorialise this most faithful of pets, the community buried Shep on a bluff overlooking the station, his name spelled out in bold yellow letters, and his painted silhouette watching the platform for eternity.\\n5. Tawny the lion\\nIt's perhaps Los Angeles Pet Memorial Park, founded in 1928, that most stretches what we think of as a pet. In a city where, writes Koudounaris, \\\"weird was the norm when it came to animal burials\\\", many of the deceased were performers in Hollywood's film industry or faithful friends of stars. Mae West's monkey, Boogie, is there, as is Topper, Hopalong Cassidy's trusty steed. Among them is Tawny (1918-40), the roaring lion at the start of an MGM film, and a regular in the Tarzan movies. Owner Mary McMillan doted on Tawny, who she rescued from a circus when he was a cub. Neighbours were less enthusiastic, woken in the night by his almighty roar. When Cinderella, a stray tomcat, joined the household, the two felines must have sensed their shared genealogy. Though vastly different in size, they became inseparable. Fitting, then, that they now share one grave.\\n6. Blinky the hen\\nIn 1978, Los Angeles Pet Memorial Park's tolerance for weirdness was really tested when conceptual artist Jeffrey Vallance turned up requesting a burial for Blinky, a headless Foster Farms fryer chicken he had purchased from the frozen section of his local supermarket. As the cemetery's staff was expecting a pet hen with feathers intact, this bald lump of meat must have raised more than a few eyebrows. Whether it was a piece of performance art or a prank at the cemetery's expense, the act raised important questions about cultural norms that cherish some animals while see others only as food.\\n7. Emily the rat and friends\\nAn uptick in animal rights awareness in the early 1990s saw activism seep into pet cemeteries, replacing the avant-garde art created by Vallance with hard-hitting, unambiguous inscriptions. At the six-acre (24,281 sq m) Aspin Hill Memorial Park, a pet cemetery in Maryland, US, a memorial, topped with a chubby rodent nursing its tail, is dedicated to \\\"the millions of rats used in medical experimentation and product testing\\\". Elsewhere in the cemetery, a grave full of sable coats labelled \\\"products of human ignorance and vanity\\\" needles again at our conscience.\\n8.

But reaching the Olympics always seemed like a tall order.\",\"summary\":\"New York CNN \\u2014\\nEdwin Moses always loved the sport of track and field. But reaching the Olympics always seemed like a tall order.\\nAt a young age, Moses was a lot smaller than the other runners. In high school, he was 5-feet-7 tall and weighed 117 pounds and frequently found himself at the back of the pack during races. But as he grew physically, he got faster and progessively found himself leading races, rather than trailing.\\nThen at Morehouse College, Moses \\u2013 a physics and engineer major \\u2013 used maths to calculate that he needed to take exactly 13 steps between hurdles to maximize efficiency in the 400-meter hurdles.\\n'It just really made sense when you're out on the track and you're dealing with running 400m worth of hurdles, 10 hurdles, then it behooves you to kind of find the shortest way or the most efficient way,' Moses told CNN.\\nUsing that methodology, Moses would go onto become a two-time Olympic gold medalist and a two-time world champion.\\nFor nine years, nine months and nine days Moses was unbeaten in races, winning 122 in a row. No other athlete has come close to breaking that record.\\nWhile the sports world was consumed with his unprecedented winning streak, Moses was not. 'I just went about my business, did my program and let the winning take care of itself. I always knew that I was 100% ready no matter what.'\\nAt the height of his popularity, Moses \\u2013 who was once considered shy and to have a quiet personality \\u2013 became a 'big mouth,' he says, as he fought against racism, performance enhancing drugs and unfair compensation in his sport.\\nHis activism put his amateur eligibility at risk and made him the subject of high-profile scandals. But he believes speaking out as he did back in the 1970s and 1980s has benefited Olympic athletes today.\\n'The reason that they're all making money today is because the fact that I sacrificed my potential eligibility for the Olympic Games and could have been banned and was investigated for taking money when it wasn't lawful,' Moses, 69, said. 'That's why track and field and swimming, gymnastics and all of them can do anything today.'\\nFifty years after he burst onto the international stage, Moses is still using sports as a vehicle for change.\\nFor 20 years, he was the inaugural chairman of the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation, an organization that helps children overcome struggles in their lives. Today, while in a different role with Laureus, he remains committed to using sports to make a difference in the lives of children all over the world.\\nMoses' journey on and off the field is chronicled in the new documentary, 'Moses \\u2013 13 Steps,' produced by Oscar-winner Morgan Freeman. It is a story the athlete has wanted to tell for nearly 20 years.\\nMoses and I spoke at length about his journey.\\nWhy did you want to participate in this documentary?\\nIn 2005, I was at the Laureus World Sports Awards. And Morgan was our special host and he introduced me and he said: 'Edwin Moses, nine years, nine months, nine days, 122 races, Morehouse man, undefeated world champion, Olympic champion.' And he said: 'Why is there no film on Edwin Moses?'\\nAnd so, it became kind of something that I really wanted to do. And my friends quite frankly were demanding it.\\nAnd then later in 2020, right before the COVID epidemic started, I was approached by a film team out of Germany, Broadview TV. And we started discussing the possibility of doing a film. They're an international boutique documentary firm and they understood the story because they're Germans. A lot of my history of running track and the IOC and all those activities happened in Europe.\\nSo that's how the concept got started.\\nWhen the winning streak of 122 straight races ended in Madrid in 1987, how did that moment feel?\\nI was food poisoned that night, that whole week. So I really didn't want to run. But I did and I ran faster than I had ever run that early in the season because I generally didn't do a lot of early season meets and I waited for the European season, like June through October.\\nI could have lost any of the 122 races. I had run sick, had run injured and had I not hit that last hurdle, I would have won that race, 100%.\\nThat one false step did me in that day. But I was not disappointed with the results. I was quite happy, the world championships were coming up about two months later, so I knew I was in tip-top condition. So it didn't really matter to me. If you get your heart broken because you lose in track and field, you're in the wrong sport.\\nShould politics be a part of sports?\\nIt is a part of sports. I mean, sports has its own specific issues in politics. We see them all the time today. You have fights and spats over drug tests. You have fights and spats over eligibility where some athletes live in one country and want to switch to another country, over gender, over nationalism.\\nSo it's always there. And the United States, we're the only Olympic committee in the world that doesn't have a sports minister. So all these other countries, their sports is directly linked to their politics except ours. So it's absolutely involved.\\nIt has a lot to do with all the decisions that are made that we never hear about generally in public, the average person doesn't know. But it's all government driven behind the scenes, just not on the track. On the track and in the field, people think that it should be non-political and it is because of the nature of sports.\\nBut behind the scenes politics is weighing heavily on everything that happens in the world of sports.\\nFrom where the Olympics are held, to where the football World Cup is held and everything in between, it's all dictated by politics.\\nWhen Olympians John Carlos and Tommie Smith put their fists up in the air while on the podium at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico, as a Black boy growing up in Dayton, Ohio, what did that moment mean to you?\\nYou have to understand the perspective of the times. In the sixties, we had multiple assassinations. Robert Kennedy. John Kennedy. Medgar Evers. Malcolm X., Dr. Martin Luther King. We had the Vietnam War going on during the same time in the late sixties, early seventies.\\nWe had the civil rights laws that were being drafted in '64 and '65, the March on Washington. So the United States was a very volatile place and there was a tremendous amount going on and I was a teeny bopper during that time.\\nAt our age, 12, 13, 14, 15, we were beginning to understand what the world was about because you could see it on the news and what kind of constraints that we were under as Black kids still in segregated high schools in Dayton, Ohio.\\nWhen we saw Tommy and John, it was just great because we had an example right in our faces as to the power of African American men and their voice on the issues. Although theirs was a worldwide issue, everyone had their fists in the air. So it was great.\\nWhat does Morehouse mean to you?\\nMorehouse changed my life. I went there at a fantastic time to go there. When I was a student, no one was talking about the HBCUs (historically Black colleges and universities) the way that they talk about them now.\\nI went at 17 years old as a little boy and came out the other end as a man. They taught us about leadership and academics and responsibility and gave us the confidence that we can go out into the world and accomplish anything in any area.\\nWe didn't have to worry about anyone concerned about why we were out of school, whether we were on academic welfare at the school. And we didn't have to worry about anyone stabbing us in the back and everyone's cheering for each other. So for me, it was the only atmosphere in which I could have thrived.\\nIf I'd have gone to name the school and name the track program with all the best coaches and everything, there would have never been no Edwin Moses. It was that unique area and opportunity despite the fact that we had no track and had no field. That's the kind of power that a Morehouse education can provide for you and give you the confidence that you can do anything even if it's impossible.\",\"rights\":\"cnn.com\",\"rank\":78,\"topic\":\"news\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"CNN,Sabrina Clay\",\"media\":\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap24240511035580.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":\"@CNNSport\",\"_score\":3.174794,\"_id\":\"82ec0718fa391cec9510e7ed4704a2cd\"},{\"title\":\"The U.S. Retirement System Will Fail Most Future Retirees\",\"author\":\"Teresa Ghilarducci\",\"published_date\":\"2024-09-22 12:25:43\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/teresaghilarducci/2024/09/22/the-us-retirement-system-will-fail-most-future-retirees\",\"clean_url\":\"forbes.com\",\"excerpt\":\"Almost half of middle-class workers will be poor or poor retirees.\",\"summary\":\"Double exposure with hands holding money in the jar and glasses, calculator and pen on financial ... [+] papers background. save money for investment concept\\nCareful research done by PhD economists conclude we face a huge retirement shortfall. We are about eight to nine years away from Social Security's inability to pay full benefits; all boomers are past age 60, and the typical Gen Y and Millennial is predicted to do a little worse or much worse than the cohorts of their big brothers, sisters, and parents. The erosion in retirement security is worse for the bottom 60% or so of the earnings distribution. Yes it's a crisis.\\nEarly boomers at the top of the income distribution have benefited from run-ups in the stock market, owning houses, and having employers who helped them save in retirement accounts and funded defined benefit plans. The top 20% of earners get 44% of all the employer contributions according to Vanguard who examined 401(k) - type employer plans. The nation's private, commercial, voluntary employer \\u2013 retirement plans exacerbate pay inequity and retirement income inequality.\\nEven Andrew Biggs, economist at the conservative think tank, American Enterprise Institute (which has been associated with partially privatizing and reducing Social Security benefits) agrees federal and state tax law steer tax breaks to the top earners.\\nAnd can we really say we don't have a retirement crisis for regular working households when new 2022 data from the Federal Reserve bank the Survey of Consumer Finance, shows the middle 70% of households by income aged 50-65 have a median retirement account savings of $86,000 and a median debt of $89,700? If you withdraw from your $86,000, say between age 65 and 70, traveling, buying a car\\u2014 you'll look comfortable. But all that money could be gone by your mid-seventies and then it's Social Security all the way to the end.\\nAbout 40% of middle-class older workers are projected to be downwardly mobile into poverty or near poverty when they reach age 62 and beyond. Disagreements rest on the definition of 'poverty.' How can a serious researcher say $13,000 a year is a standard to shoot for; I reject the U.S. definition of poverty and so do most experts and practitioners.\\nThe U.S. poverty measures depart from internationally acceptable standards and consistently lowballs how much hardship we have. No serious researcher uses the U.S. standard as a measure of financial deprivation. Most antipoverty programs define poverty as 150% or 200% of the official rate. According to the U.S. official number, you are a poor elder if your annual income is below about $13,000. Internationally, an American elder is counted as poor when their incomes fall below 50% of median, which is about $21,000. Measured this way, my coauthors including economist Siavash Radpour, found downward mobility worsening after the pandemic.\\nThe U.S. has the highest rate of elder poverty of any of our peer advanced-Western countries. By international standards, one out of four elder Americans over 65 live in a chronic state of want, in comparison the elder poverty rate is a low 5% in the Netherlands and about 10% in Germany, which is not atypical. This is a crisis and a shame.\\nTony Webb, Michael Papadopoulos, and I found in the Illusory Benefits of Working Longer that without working, 79% of people in 2028 age 62-70 would not be able to afford their pre-retirement living standards or stay about de-facto poverty levels. And we included everything we could estimate \\u2014 defined benefit plan benefits, Social Security, home equity!\\nI can see how this grim assessment puzzles people if you just encountered a careful paper by Peter J. Brady of the Investment Company Institute and Stephan Bass at Internal Revenue Service. But they didn't look forward boomers aging or Gen Y and younger. They only studied the relatively-advantaged 1945 birth cohort at age 72 and included earnings from paid work. They conclude retirement looks better than many think. But they make no claims about the future. They can't. And people working aren't retired. This cohort also got the best part of traditional defined benefit pension plans, they were able to collect peak Social Security benefits before the raising the retirement age cut benefits for middle boomers and younger, and who got the most out of a steady increase in housing asset values.\\nAnd, Harvard economist Karen Dyson et. al. agree the younger cohorts will likely do worse than current retirees.\\nDeniers also cherry \\u2013 pick surveys show most retirees feel comfortable. But comfort levels depends on the survey. We surveyed the surveys. The results depend on who you ask. Eight robust and frequently-cited surveys on retirement confidence conducted by government bodies, research groups, and industry advocates show a wide range of retirement anxiety, from a high of 71% to a low of 32%. Levels of retirement anxieties differ by age, working status, and retirement status. The majority of near retirees in the middle and lower incomes are the most nervous about their retirement futures. And they should be.\\nBottom line. The startling finding that 79% of age 62 \\u2013 70 don't have enough retirement income, without working surprised me. But projections based on real wealth data from the University of Michigan convinces me it's true. New data could change my mind.\\nBiggs is right. This assertion needs modifying: 'Nearly half of older Americans have no retirement savings and must rely solely on Social Security in old age.' I should have written:\\nI agree 100 percent dependence on Social Security is rare. And the Census Bureau analyzed only 12.2 percent of seniors get at least 90 percent of their income from Social Security. I agree many people have Social Security and other forms of income at young old ages. But as you age those other sources of income fade away. Work disappears, cash piles are spent, expenses rise, you live longer and sicker than you think, and levels eroded away by inflation.\\nAs MIT economist James Poterba and colleagues note \\u2014 in research that needs updating \\u2014 a substantial fraction of persons die with virtually no financial assets and rely almost entirely on Social Security benefits for support. True, many of these households may be deemed to have been prepared for retirement because their income in old age was not substantially lower than their low income in their late 50s or early 60s. But saying a high replacement rate of a very low income (which is what incomes are right before retirement typically) is surely a poor way to judge sufficiency.\\nRetirement crisis deniers promote their rosy picture about retirement by taking snapshots when people are relatively young retirees and working at older ages in professional jobs. The average income of 70-year-olds looks a lot different than the median income of 75- or 80-year-olds.\\nAnd we are going backwards. People in retirement used to be closer together in terms of income and wealth. People in retirement now and in the future are farther apart, retirement income inequality is growing along with longevity inequality. See the new book Longer Lives Are for the Rich .\\nAdditionally, economists John Sabelhaus and Alice Henriques Volz find that the people in the top wealth levels are doing a bit better (based on the wealth they have they expect to use in old age) than people born 10 and 20 year years earlier. A rosy picture there. But a full 50% of people at the bottom of the wealth distribution are doing worse than their older sisters and brothers' cohort and parents' cohort who were at the same place in terms of their wealth at their age. This isn't about how much they will get; it is a finding that shows our retirement system has aged so that some people are going backwards, and inequality is increasing.\\nRetirement financial security for Baby Boomers and Generation Xers is worse than for earlier retirees. I agree with Alicia Munnell, I don't care what you call the problem \\u2013 a crisis or very bad problem \\u2014 'roughly half of households are not in good financial shape in retirement.'\\nThe retirement crisis deniers don't show up advocating more revenue into Social Security. The retirement crisis deniers say that 12.9% or 10% poverty measured the American way shows we don't have to make large reforms. But the facts are restoring and expanding Social Security would prevent major setbacks. In 'How-Gloomy is the Retirement Outlook- respected Urban Institute researchers Karen Smith and Richard Johnson show that median age-70 income will be higher for Millennials than previous generations, but this cohort faces a higher risk of seeing falling living standards in retirement.\\nHigher income in retirement does not mean being better off if people face more expenses and are living longer. As Forbes contributor Howard Gleckman writes, the biggest threat to over half of earners retirement security \\u2014 those in the lower and middle class \\u2014 is to not do anything about fully funding and expanding Social Security.\\nIn the end, one of the best portraits of the retirement crisis comes from a compilation of academic work and government statistics. Check out the Chartbook, for snapshots older workers' status and retirement wealth. Make up your own mind about whether we have a problem so big we need to fix the commercial and voluntary system and Social Security. I guess you can still think everything is fine and there is nothing to be done, but I would want to see the numbers. for me the facts show otherwise.\",\"rights\":\"forbes.com\",\"rank\":63,\"topic\":\"news\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Senior Contributor,Teresa Ghilarducci\",\"media\":\"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66edbd243e143d515149af72/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":\"@forbes\",\"_score\":3.0906885,\"_id\":\"cb032d0effd0b55f0bffd312129461bb\"},{\"title\":\"\\u2018We have done more in 11 weeks than the Tories did in 11 years': Keir Starmer defends his record\",\"author\":\"Andrew Rawnsley\",\"published_date\":\"2024-09-21 18:59:37\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/21/we-have-done-more-in-11-weeks-than-the-tories-did-in-11-years-keir-starmer-defends-his-record\",\"clean_url\":\"theguardian.com\",\"excerpt\":\"After days of freebie rows, leaks and squabbles, the prime minister expresses frustration and says that at Labour's conference this week he will explain what a better Britain looks like\",\"summary\":\"Before the election, Keir Starmer said he was determined to ensure that he didn't let being prime minister deny him time with his family and made a kind of promise to his wife and two children that Friday nights would be sacrosanct. When we meet him at No 10, we wonder how that is working out. 'In some respects, that's a little bit easier because it's a 30 seconds commute,' he says, pointing upwards to the living quarters. 'The kids can pop in when they get back from school, even if it's only for a few minutes before they go up to the flat.'\\nOn the other hand, the schedule since Labour took office has been 'relentless'. Getting the government going on its domestic agenda has been accompanied by a packed calendar of foreign travel, including a Washington summit, a Nato summit, visits to Italy and Ireland, and two trips to 'reset the relationship with key partners' to France and Germany. 'Making time is important, because you're a better decision-maker if you have a bit of time with your family.' He speaks with regret about cancelling his summer holiday after the August outbreak of far-right violence on the streets. 'It would have been good to have got away over the summer for a break, if I'm honest, because we've been running at this for a long time. Whilst the campaign itself was six and a bit weeks, the truth is we've been in campaign mode since at least the turn of the year. I haven't had a day off since Rishi stood out there in the rain without his umbrella. I also know that this is not a good thing. Everybody, including politicians, needs to get away from time to time to have holidays.'\\nThere may be some public sympathy that he has not had a day off. Much less so about the revelations that he's been happy to take a lot of freebies. The value of the gifts he accepted in the last parliament comes in north of \\u00a3100,000, ahead of any other MP. Given the stink it is causing, does he now regret being so free with the freebies? 'It is very easy to say politicians shouldn't have any gifts,' he responds. 'But it is quite tricky in practice.'\\nHe focuses his justification on accepting hospitality at football matches, presumably because he thinks he can muster a more solid defence for this than he can for some of the other gift-taking that is raising eyebrows. He's had a season ticket to watch Arsenal 'for a very long time. I go with my boy, I go with our friends and we go in the stands. That is what we do, week in and week out, during the season.'\\nIf he'd carried on using the stands, 'they'd have to put in a hell of a security detail to get me in there which would cost quite a lot of money. As a result, I was offered a gift to move elsewhere in the stadium to watch the game.' He'd rather be in the stands but contends that it would be 'a bit self-indulgent' to insist on it 'if that costs the taxpayer a fortune in extra security'.\\nSome voters may find that a reasonable argument. But what about the rest of it: the Taylor Swift and Coldplay tickets along with the clothing and 'luxury eyewear' valued at more than \\u00a32,000 bought for him by a wealthy Labour donor who was temporarily given a pass to No 10 after the election and who also provided high-end clothes for the prime minister's wife, Victoria.\\nThe typical voter has to pay for clothes and treats out of their own pocket and surely will be wondering why a prime minister who says he is the champion of working people isn't doing the same. Doesn't this make people think it's no different to the Tories?\\nHe swerves this challenge. 'If you look at what we promised to voters, we promised that we would bring about change. Make sure the economy works so \\u2026 they were better off. Make sure the health service is working properly. Bring down their energy bills.' At the end of his list, he says: 'That's what I'll be judged on. I know I'll be judged at the end of the five years, and rightly so.'\\nBut might he also not be judged on freebies which aren't a happy fit with his manifesto commitment to introduce a much more ethical regime to government. 'I've always said the rules have to be complied with. What I went after [Boris] Johnson on was not complying with the rules.'\\nSubsequent to our conversation, and following revelations that Angela Rayner, Rachel Reeves and other members of Labour's top team have taken donations to buy outfits, the government has surrendered to pressure to stop accepting clothes as gifts. But during our interview, Starmer refuses to agree that it would be best not to take any freebies at all.\\n'Well look,' he says defiantly. 'I mean, am I going to now say I won't go to another Arsenal game? Then, no.' What about the designer specs? 'I don't need any new specs for a long time.'\\nThe other toxic stream of stories in the run-up to the Labour conference has been about infighting at No 10. The most recent outbreak of backbiting has centred on the salary paid to his chief of staff, Sue Gray. At \\u00a3170,000 a year, her remuneration comes in higher than his own. Does this indicate that she is the most powerful person in Downing Street?\\n'I'm not going to talk about individual salaries for any member of staff,' he responds before saying something that shouldn't really need saying. 'I'm the person who runs the government. I'm the person that takes the decisions and I'm the person that takes responsibility for those decisions.'\\nDetails of who is earning what at No 10 and how X is jostling for influence with Y do not come from nowhere. They're coming from people on the inside passing information to journalists. Why is his ship such a leaky one? 'There shouldn't be any leaking,' he says, not denying that leakers are responsible. 'That just damages everybody.'\\nHe doesn't quarrel with the suggestion that he needs to get a grip before it spirals completely out of control. 'It's my job to do something about that and I accept that responsibility.'\\nHe argues that it is highly unfair to suggest that squabbles about salaries is the only story to be told about his government. 'In the other column, I would point out: what is No 10 focused on every day? What's the cabinet focused on every day?'\\nWith that, he launches into a 'rattle through what we've done', which includes setting up the national wealth fund and GB Energy, putting a new planning framework in place to encourage swifter construction of essential national infrastructure and more homebuilding, as well as starting recruitment of additional police officers and teachers.\\nSign up to Observed\\nAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers\\nafter newsletter promotion\\n'If you look at the list of what we have already done in 11 weeks, then I would argue strongly that we've done far more than the last government did probably in the last 11 years.'\\nHe continues: 'Leaking, I know how damaging it is. In the end, it only damages the government, so I'm not going to pretend otherwise. But I would also point out there's a lot of work that's gone on, being delivered through No 10 and the cabinet.'\\nSince he arrived there, he's delivered a lot of words about the direness of the inheritance from the Tories and accompanied this with the warning that things are going to get worse before they get better. Can the Labour conference, which opens on Sunday in Liverpool, expect a further deluge of miserabilism or will he have some more optimistic things to say to his party and to the public? 'I want to answer the 'why' question as well as the 'what' question. In the first 11 weeks, we have answered the 'what' question \\u2013 what did we inherit? This \\u00a322bn black hole is a real problem \\u2026 We're going to have to deal with it upfront.'\\nIf Labour is ultimately to deliver improved economic growth and everything else it has promised, it has 'to do the tough things first' so 'in years to come, people will look back and say: 'That Labour government in 2024 really got to grips with it.''\\nHe embarks on one of his favoured metaphors, which is to compare his task to restoring a rotting building. 'When you're redecorating a house, you can be tempted to paint over the damp and the cracks, and people do. Landlords often do. But the damp comes back. The cracks are still there.' Better, he argues, to 'strip it down' to do the job properly.\\nThe criticism, which is to be widely heard among his colleagues, is that he has not painted an appealing picture of what it will be like living in the house once it has been refurbished. 'We had to make it clear what the inheritance was. But, to accept your challenge, we do need to say why and explain and set out and describe the better Britain that this ladders up to.' He adds: 'That is the central purpose of my conference speech, which is to answer that very question.'\\nThere will be ructions at the conference from trades unions and party activists who oppose ending the universality of the winter fuel payment by restricting it to pensioners on pension credit. He continues to defend the government's most contentious act so far. 'We've got \\u00a322bn to find and there are no easy decisions when you've got \\u00a322bn to find\\u2026 We couldn't pretend it's not there\\u2026 That means really difficult decisions.'\\nHe also suggests that there will be more of them to come. 'It's going to be tough' he says of Reeves's budget at the end of October.\\nHe has a potentially more reassuring message for those who fear that a Labour version of austerity is coming down the track which will entail deep cuts to public spending. 'I'm acutely aware that our public services are on their knees. I ran a public service. I know what cuts feel like. And I know that a lot of them are cut to the bone.'\\nHe has been heard to say in the past that the time he spent as an opposition MP were 'the most futile' of his life. For all the battalions of troubles already assailing him, he's clearly relishing holding the levers of power. Comparing government with opposition, he remarks: 'It's much tougher, but much better, if that makes sense. It's tougher than being in opposition because you've got to make real decisions.

And it's mixed with salad oil.\\nTino DeAngelis had an early business start in the meat industry. He was allegedly involved in black market sales during World War II. He paid $100,000 in damages for exporting substandard cooking fat to Yugoslavia. After acquiring control of a public meatpacker, he was required to pay new damages of $100,000 because of inferior products. Then another one of his companies was accused of exporting inferior lard to Germany, resulting in 'the usual' $100,000 in damages. DeAngelis later created Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Refining Corporation (Allied). Allegations of fraud and underworld connections followed him.\\nAmerican Express Company (Amex) was dominant in travel and financial services. In 1960, Howard Clark became chief executive. His priority was focusing on the viability of the money-losing American Express credit card. He then focused on four marginally-profitable Amex subsidiaries. One was the separately incorporated American Express Field Warehousing Company (AEFW). It had made money in only 10 of the past 19 years and had a cumulative loss. In the late 1950s, AEFW had 500 client accounts, but all the profits were from two companies, with the same owner: DeAngelis. One company was Allied.\\nIn 1956, Warren Buffett, age 25, started his first investment partnership. In 1962, He dissolved all eleven partnerships and brought them into Buffett Partnership Ltd. (BPL). Net assets were $7.2 million. Buffett was already a millionaire. BPL had strong performance. Buffett inherited his value-investing style from Benjamin Graham. Buffett viewed stock investing akin to owning a business, but only at a reasonable price. Buffett's 1964 investment in Amex would begin a different investing approach.\\nPrior to Buffett's Amex acquisition, he pushed for board representation or control, like with his Dempster Mill Manufacturing Company investment. Buffett pushed management to increase profits but was unsuccessful. So, he installed a new manager who turned things around, but at a reputational cost to Buffett. The new management team laid off one hundred workers from the only town factory. Buffett was vilified in the local newspaper. Starting with Amex, Buffett's approach was to first uncover undervalued firms that were fundamentally good businesses with capable managers, then let them do their jobs.\\nIn June 1960, Donald Miller, chief executive of AEFW, received a phone call from a tipster, 'the Voice.' He claimed to work the night shift at Allied in Bayonne, New Jersey. He warned Miller, 'The biggest hoax ever pulled is being pulled on American Express because there is in fact water in the tanks, and we are counting it as oil. Whenever we went to take inventory at the tank, we would be dropping the weight into this metal chamber, which was filled with soybean oil, but the balance of the tank had water in it.'\\nMiller ordered a surprise inspection at Allied. Inspectors found all the tank openings were welded shut except for the measuring hatch. They then found water in the five tanks they were able to check. However, when they returned after the weekend, there was nothing suspicious in the other tanks. A report later attributed water to 'broken steam pipes.' Business between Allied and AEFW continued as usual.\\nUnbeknownst to investigators, DeAngelis had created an elaborate network of pipes with false compartments and special sampling tubes that held actual oil. Three years later, when the fraud was finally detected, when the tap on one tank was finally opened, instead of $4 million of soybean oil, seawater poured out for 12 days.\\nIn 1961, Allied started buying heavily in the oil futures market. By 1963, DeAngelis was pushing up the prices of oil futures in anticipation of heavy demand by foreign countries. Rumors swirled that Russia's crops had failed, and Russia would soon be buying U.S. vegetable oil. Actually, there were bumper foreign crops, so high futures prices weren't sustainable.\\nWith each subsequent oil price decline, Allied needed to provide more money in margin accounts. By November 1963, the exchanges and government commodities agencies finally realized that Allied was driving up futures prices. When a commodities exchange investigator demanded to see Allied's records, the gig was up. Allied filed for bankruptcy. Futures prices plummeted. AEFW's warehouse receipts had totaled twice as much vegetable oil as all the oil in the U.S.\\nAmex was a joint stock company, the last large U.S. public company with unlimited liability. By 1963, Amex was considering incorporating, becoming a limited liability company like almost all other public companies.\\nSoon after Allied went bankrupt, claims against AEFW were more than $150 million, close to the year-end value of Amex's stock of $162 million. Since AEFW was a separately incorporated subsidiary, Amex probably wasn't responsible for its liabilities. But there were legal rules that might have overridden the separation. This created uncertainty about Amex's potential liability.\\nRegardless, Clark pondered whether Amex should compensate losses at AEFW. He considered important stakeholders with different perspectives. If Amex denied liability for AEFW, banks would suffer losses. Given the huge role banks played in Amex's travelers cheques business, that might kill all the business banks brought to Amex.\\nConversely, satisfying bankers might upset shareholders. Clark also had to consider how the swindle would affect customers. Would they stop using Amex products? With permission of the board, on November 27, 1963, Clark publicly announced: 'If our subsidiary should be liable for amounts in excess of its insurance coverage and other assets, American Express Company feels morally bound to do everything it can, consistent with its overall responsibilities, to see that such excess liabilities are satisfied.'\\nThe swindle started featuring in the press on November 20, 1963, with few details. Two days later, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. $11 billion in shareholder value was destroyed in the half hour before an emergency closure of the NYSE. Kennedy's death relegated the Great Salad Oil Swindle to the back pages. Intrigued by the possibility of buying the stock cheaply, Buffett tracked Amex's stock price. Even after markets reopened, the stock never recovered and continued to drop. Based on the market's reaction, the survival of Amex was in doubt. Between November 20 to December 2, its price dropped from $61.81 to $40.00 and would bottom on June 2, 1964, at $35.31, a drop of 43 percent in less than eight months since the scandal broke.\\nBuffett wondered what impact the scandal would have on Amex's reputation. With travelers cheques and credit cards, trust mattered. Buffett needed facts. So he and an acquaintance visited restaurants and other places that accepted Amex cards and cheques. They talked to bank tellers, bank officers, credit-card users, hotels employees, and restaurants workers to get a feel for whether usage had fallen off. Based on that research, Buffett concluded that while Wall Street had punished Amex by battering the stock price, Amex's reputation hadn't been tarnished on Main Street.\\nBy early 1964, BPL was flush with cash from both profits and new money, with capital of $17.5 million. It takes both strong conviction and nerves of steel for to risk huge amounts of capital on one stock. But that's what Buffett did. By June 1964, he had invested $3 million in Amex, BPL's largest single holding, at 17 percent.\\nBefore an eventual resolution with creditors, some shareholders took action against the firm, arguing Amex had no legal obligation to settle liabilities of AEFW. They felt any settlement would hurt Amex's shareholder value. They were particularly concerned that holders of many forged warehouse receipts that DeAngelis invented would be compensated.\\nBuffett felt management was doing the right thing and was concerned that trying to derail any settlement would damage the brand. Buffett sent a letter to Clark, praising management, and imploring them to settle for the sake of reputation. Buffett likened the situation to a typhoon that would soon pass. He even offered to testify, at his own expense, supporting management's actions. This was another pivotal moment for Buffett, taking a long-term perspective, willing to sacrifice short-term profitability. Buffett's assessment of Amex's future was accurate. Almost six decades later, Buffett still owned Amex stock.\\nThe period when Buffett was buying Amex's stock was mid-April to June 1964. Its average price was $41.22. Two-and-a-half years later, Amex's stock was $92.50, a gain of 124 percent. The Dow lost 6 percent over that period. Given the amount of capital risked, Buffett's ability to buy near the bottom, and the huge gains in such a brief period, arguably this was one of the best investments ever, certainly for Buffett and his partnership.\\nBy 1967, Amex negotiated a $60 million settlement with creditors. After-tax, that was $31.6 million. Profits between the time the scandal broke and the settlement exceeded that amount. Amex was able to put the scandal behind it by late 1964.\\nAmex executives later realized the swindle was the greatest public-relations event in its history. Press coverage was favorable, and the public saw that Amex stood behind its obligations. In 1964 travelers cheques sales increased by 12 percent. Later Clark was asked if a salad oil swindle every few years might be a clever idea. He replied: 'I don't think I have enough good years of my life to give away for another swindle.'\\nThe scandal showed why character and reputation matter. DeAngelis had a long record of unscrupulous behavior and never really changed. Paying fines was just a cost of doing business. Yet it didn't deter other companies from dealing with him, until his empire came crashing down.\\nWhy did banks and commodity exporters increasingly lend to DeAngelis's businesses? Before his downfall, rumors had swirled for years that a swindle was happening at Allied. Partly, it was tunnel vision. One lender commented, 'We didn't deal with this Tino character. We dealt with American Express.' There's no substitute for your own analysis. Buffett did a lot of legwork before investing in Amex. He didn't simply rely on a hunch.\\nClark made a bold decision by pronouncing that Amex was 'morally bound' to cover AEFW's liability. He recognized the importance of a brand's reputation. He also didn't let a good crisis go to waste. Both Clark and Buffett recognized that long-term value trumped short-term profit.\\nWhat was the root cause of the scandal? Incentives and motives matter. To survive, AEFW needed to show consistent profits. This may have caused Donald Miller to overlook DeAngelis's character flaws, since his dealings with Allied were profitable. As author Norman Miller concluded, 'Tino succeeded because bankers, brokers and business[people], despite the glaring indications that they were dealing with a crook, could not resist the bait of big profits\\u2026The reason they were convinced that Tino's deals were good can be stated in one word\\u2014greed.'\\nThose bankers, brokers, and businesspeople were all greedy until they feared they would lose it all. Buffett turned that premise on its head when he famously proclaimed his investing goal: 'We simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.' Stocks may become overvalued when everyone wants to invest in them, and undervalued when no one wants them.\\nAdapted with permission from the publisher, Wiley, from Trailblazers, Heroes, and Crooks: Stories to Make You a Smarter Investor by Stephen R.

Approach at your own peril.\",\"summary\":\"As my boat cruises toward the private island city of Indian Creek Village \\u2014 better known as the Billionaire Bunker \\u2014 I'm hoping my trip doesn't end in an arrest.\\nIt's a hot morning on South Florida's Biscayne Bay, and I've convinced two local tour boat captains to pilot me around the perimeter of what is quite possibly the wealthiest and most heavily defended town in America. I'm not entirely clear on the rules about boating near the island, which lies just across the bay from Miami, and neither are my captains \\u2014 they're both in their first weeks on the job. What I do know is that Indian Creek employs a new all-seeing security system and a small navy of police officers who frequently stop and ticket boats that venture too close to the island's manicured shore.\\nAs we near the northwestern side of the island, I spot the bright red steel beams of \\\"La Petite Clef,\\\" the Mark di Suvero sculpture that towers 20 feet over the front lawn of the car magnate Norman Braman's mansion. We glide past a modern palace hidden behind a dense cluster of palm trees, purchased for $50 million in 2019 by a mysterious LLC linked to the emir of Qatar. On the southwestern shore, we come upon the island's most sought-after mansions. This is where the elite of the elite live: Tom Brady, Carl Icahn, and the neighborhood's most recent arrival, Jeff Bezos. The wealth here is staggering \\u2014 25,000-square-foot mansions with ivy-strewn stucco walls, fronted by sprawling lawns and sleek yachts. Today, almost all the mansions appear to be empty.\\nAs we get closer to the shore, I start to notice the cameras.\\nTheir beady eyes are everywhere. Some are mounted on poles along the seawall. Others peek out from hedges. Many are connected to an inconspicuous white box \\u2014 an Israeli-designed radar system capable of detecting passersby, in low visibility, from half a mile away.\\nThere is no way for a person to set foot on Indian Creek without the express permission of one of its 89 residents or a member of its ultra exclusive country club, which reportedly costs $500,000 to join. Because the town's government serves such an ultra wealthy subset of the population, things like public parks and social programs are practically nonexistent. Instead, the lion's share of Indian Creek's budget goes to its police department \\u2014 which keeps watch on the island's sole entrance and patrols the perimeter 24/7. Through federal funds, the town has also amassed a panoply of other security measures that would make Bezos' Ring cameras blush.\\n\\\"The wealthier you become, the more you want perfect security,\\\" says Setha Low, the director of the Public Space Research Group, a center at the City University of New York that focuses on the access and control of everything from city parks to gated communities. \\\"And that produces an industry making a lot of money off of people's fear.\\\" Much like the military-industrial complex, she says, \\\"there's a security-industrial complex \\u2014 this entire sector of our economy being fed by people wanting this kind of security.\\\"\\nI'm relieved when we pull away before running into an Indian Creek police patrol. But there's no doubt we've been seen. In an increasingly atomized age, the Billionaire Bunker is an increasingly insular and secure enclave. If you want to live in a part of America that no outsiders can set foot in, Indian Creek is the most gated community in a country of gates.\\nDredged from the Tiffany-blue waters of Biscayne Bay in 1928, Indian Creek was incorporated in 1939 under a now defunct Florida law that allowed groups of more than 25 people to form their own municipalities. Designed to re-create the English countryside, the 300-acre island is more than 80% golf course, encircled by a single road and 30 or so mansions. The village was initially envisioned as a refuge for wealthy white gentiles. Early residents included William Henry Hoover, of vacuum fame, and Frank Woolworth, the eponymous founder of the department-store chain. Back then, residents conspired to keep Jewish homebuyers out by running their electric services exclusively through the formally segregated Indian Creek Country Club.\\nThat system of de facto segregation no longer exists, but Indian Creek remains fixated on keeping certain people out. \\\"The security is very different than how it used to be,\\\" says Gerardo Vildostegui, who grew up in the neighboring town of Surfside, a middle-class community that shares a two-lane bridge with Indian Creek. A member of Surfside's town council, Vildostegui recalls a time in the early '90s when he could bring his college friends to Indian Creek's gate and get permission from the police to give them a tour of the island. Now if he approaches the bridge, the cops start flashing their lights and order him to back away.\\nIn the 1980s, the island's police force \\u2014 whose motto is \\\"protecting and serving America's most exclusive municipality\\\" \\u2014 was made up of 11 people. Recent town documents show they employ 19, one for every five residents. That's compared with a national average of about 2.4 cops per 1,000 residents. If New York City had the same officer-to-citizen ratio as Indian Creek, it would employ more than 1.5 million cops. Because Indian Creek's denizens are jet-setting billionaires with homes all over the world, there are likely many days of the year when police officers actually outnumber the island's residents.\\nIf New York City had the same officer-to-citizen ratio as Indian Creek, it would employ more than 1.5 million cops.\\nOften described as \\\"butlers with badges,\\\" the Indian Creek police force is unlike most of its counterparts. For starters, it's nonunion. The town government quashed a union drive in the 1980s, firing a lead organizer accused of taking gasoline from a town tank. And rather than responding to calls from citizens in need, the police spend an estimated 97% of their time on security work, like patrolling the island's perimeter in three high-speed police boats and manning the access command center by the bridge. The force's recruitment materials say officers have \\\"extremely high levels of training in areas such as weapons, defensive tactics, and tactical operations\\\" and are trained to use fully automatic firearms. All told, the town spent $4.1 million \\u2014 a whopping 74% of its budget \\u2014 on public safety in fiscal year 2023.\\nIn 2011, the town installed new cameras by the entrance gate that allow police to simultaneously view a visitor's face, pull up their driver's license, and read their license plate. Indian Creek also narrowed the gate's opening to create what it called \\\"a greater sense of exclusivity.\\\" In 2012 the town replaced the tinted bullet-resistant glass in the access command center, and in 2013 it added a fence to keep pedestrians out. Such investments are generally lauded by residents, who often push the town council for more stringent security measures. \\\"Safety is our No. 1,\\\" Irma Braman, Norman's wife, said at one meeting. \\\"It should be everyone's No. 1.\\\"\\nWhatever crimes the island's residents may be committing, they aren't doing it on the island. Many years, not a single offense is reported to the Indian Creek police. Instead, the cops have their hands full fending off the curious boaters who try to land on the beach near the golf course. \\\"The police are being run ragged right now,\\\" Mayor Bernard Klepach \\u2014 who is also the CEO of the world's largest in-flight duty-free company \\u2014 said at a council meeting in 2020, referring not to a crime wave but to recent incursions by beachgoers. \\\"We need something quickly.\\\"\\nThat year, Indian Creek began its most substantial security upgrade in decades \\u2014 a high-tech radar fence encircling the island. According to public records, the system features 10 thermal cameras and 17 radar sensors mounted at nine locations along the island's perimeter, in addition to 30 traditional cameras. The radar sensors overlap, creating what the records call a \\\"geofence\\\" that can detect anything that comes within a half-mile of the shore. The project cost about $1.6 million \\u2014 equal to about a quarter of the village's annual budget.\\nThe radars were built by Magos, an Israeli company whose founders worked with military radar technology before shifting their focus to private security. Its website says Magos radar systems are generally used in data centers, oil and gas facilities, and solar farms. \\\"Radar works extremely well in wide-open spaces,\\\" says Mike Bullman, who runs Safe Security Solutions, a perimeter-security company that has installed Magos radars around large country estates in the United Kingdom. But he and several other security professionals I spoke with had never heard of one being installed around an entire town.\\nThe Indian Creek radar can detect objects on the water and use artificial intelligence to classify them according to the risk they pose. When a potential threat is detected, the system automatically moves a thermal camera to track it. Police officers at the station can watch a live feed on a software called \\\"Octopus,\\\" and dispatch a patrol boat to investigate.\\nJustin Ross, who's been running tours of the Biscayne Bay for several years, first noticed the perimeter-security system while boating past the island one evening in 2022. A red light from the shore appeared to latch on to his boat. \\\"I could see it moving,\\\" he recalls. \\\"I was like, oh wow, it's following me.\\\"\\nWith the new security system, the Indian Creek police appear to have turbocharged their enforcement of regulations in the surrounding waters. In 2019, the department issued 211 traffic and marine citations. In 2022, the first year the radar system was fully operational, the number of citations soared to 1,600.\\n\\\"Every time I go past Indian Creek, I run into a marine patrol guy,\\\" Ross says. He knows of plenty of boaters who have been ticketed, generally for creating a wake too close to the shore. Passing by the island earlier this year, Ross triggered the attention of an Indian Creek Police patrol. The officer hit him with a $140 ticket for not having the correct safety equipment on board. The Indian Creek police department did not respond to my inquiries.\\nResidents, for their part, have been enthusiastic about the new system, and several granted easements to allow the tech to be mounted on their property. One key selling point for the ultra wealthy townies: The cameras would never be pointed inward. Only outsiders would be targeted by the high-tech system. \\\"I think the security is great and have been happy with what has been implemented,\\\" Gail Golden, the wife of Carl Icahn, tells me. \\\"Nothing further to add.\\\"\\nIn August 2023, about a year after the perimeter system was installed, Indian Creek residents learned that they had a new neighbor. Jeff Bezos, the world's second-richest man, had spent $68 million on a waterfront mansion, quickly followed by the purchase of an abutting property worth $79 million. Then, last April, he completed a billionaire's hat trick, grabbing a $90 million mansion from Javier Holtz, the retired chairman and CEO of Marquis Bank. The Amazon tycoon got to work, applying to build a pickleball court in one of his yards and making plans to tear down two of the dwellings to construct one supermansion.\\nBezos' arrival catapulted the wealth of Indian Creek into a new stratosphere. In 2014, the entire net worth of the island's 86 residents was estimated at $37 billion. Bezos added $199 billion. The total value of property on the island is approaching $1 billion and seems poised to climb.\\n\\\"People's price expectations just jumped drastically,\\\" says Marko Gojanovic, a real-estate agent who has shown several houses on the island. Prices have more than doubled since the start of the pandemic and have increased by at least another 20% since the first Bezos deal. Gojanovic says he's been asking as much as $150 million for certain properties.\\nFor real-estate agents, Gojanovic says, \\\"access to Indian Creek is almost like gold.\\\" In off-market transactions like the Bezos sales, two or three brokers can find themselves pitching the same property. Agents are expected to keep transactions private, and Gojanovic says nondisclosure agreements are common. The true owners of several Indian Creek properties remain undisclosed, including the buyer of a $65 million property purchased this May.\\nDina Goldentayer, who served as the broker for one of the Bezos properties, says security has become a major selling point for prospective buyers. \\\"These people are buying a secure lifestyle as much as they're buying a big house,\\\" she says.\\nIn recent years, the island, which has long served as a haven for the elite, has become even more exclusive. Vildostegui, the Surfside town council member, says Island Creek residents used to feel more like local celebrities \\u2014 guys like Don Shula, the coach of the Miami Dolphins, who you might run into at church. Now, Vildostegui says, the island has become \\\"a spot on the international billionaire circuit.\\\"\\nThe new arrivals have triggered a bit of a building boom, with several projects now under construction. When I visit the entrance on a Tuesday afternoon, I count about 30 vehicles entering and exiting in less than 10 minutes \\u2014 the Teslas and BMWs of the residents and country-club members mixed in with the pickups, vans, and Toyotas of construction workers. A sign by the entrance gate reads \\\"No Trespassing: Private Island,\\\" and a black police SUV idles nearby.\\nDespite the Billionaire Bunker's fixation on remaining insular, it tends to encroach on the outside world. With on-island parking limited to construction supervisors, crews working on Indian Creek mansions sometimes park along a quiet Surfside street near the bridge. Properties in the neighborhood are also being bought up by opaquely named LLCs tied to Indian Creek residents. Julio Iglesias, a longtime Indian Creek homeowner, is particularly invested in Surfside, controlling through several LLCs at least nine properties within a few blocks of the entrance.\\nThe sprawl into Surfside became a flashpoint in the late 1990s, when Indian Creek began building a new police and government complex on the other side of the bridge. Some Surfsiders felt the station would change the character of their neighborhood, and the conflict grew petty, bringing long-simmering class tension to the surface. Town officials snubbed each other at community meetings and filed competing lawsuits. \\\"We used to tease each other that, for them, Surfside was spelled with an E instead of a U,\\\" says Tim Will, who served as a Surfside commissioner during the spat. \\\"They don't interact with us unless you're cutting their lawns or building their piers.\\\"\\nWill was particularly bothered by the bridge connecting the two towns, which receives public money for repair projects but which the public is forbidden from crossing. Actually, Indian Creek often makes use of public funds to maintain its privacy \\u2014 security projects like the radar system are almost always funded via a federal forfeiture fund.\\nIndian Creek eventually won the turf war, and the new police station was built. Tensions with Surfside seem to have cooled, but the questions of public funding and public access remain. The bridge received $875,000 in government grants in 2008, and last November the town requested another $400,000 for repairs. But when I visit the police station at the bridge and ask if I can walk across, I'm barred from entering.\\nIndian Creek's growing wealth and security mirror trends among the global superrich. Over the past four years, billionaire wealth has grown by 88%. In April, America's 806 billionaires boasted a net worth of $5.8 trillion, greater than the annual GDPs of Japan, Germany, and India \\u2014 and more wealth than the bottom half of America. Miami is frequently said to be the US city with the most extreme income inequality.\\nThe growing wealth gap has given rise to the security-industrial complex, a burgeoning field aimed at assuaging the anxieties of the superwealthy. Multiple billionaire-security professionals I spoke with described an increased interest in security among their ultra-high-net-worth clients. Some are shelling out millions on highly trained bodyguards or deploying high-tech surveillance drones. Elon Musk travels with up to 20 bodyguards at a time. Others are building bunkers to wait out the apocalypse. In Indian Creek, if you somehow evaded the islandwide surveillance dragnet that Bezos and his neighbors have amassed through public funding, you'd still have to contend with the formidable private dragnets guarding their individual mansions.\\nWalled-off communities, by their very nature, lead to ever higher walls.\\nSecurity \\\"has become a really big concern for billionaires now, because there's never been more talk about the divide between the haves and the have-nots,\\\" says Brian Daniel, who operates the Celebrity Personal Assistant Network, a company that connects billionaires to security staff. \\\"It gets people worked up.\\\" Never mind that poor people are statistically far more likely to be the victims of crime than those who can afford supermansions on private islands. Being rich means you can afford to be safe instead of sorry.\\n\\\"Trapped,\\\" a book coauthored by Low, the CUNY researcher, describes a growing movement to build communities that are \\\"privatized, fortified, unequal.\\\" By 2015, more than 11 million Americans had retreated to these \\\"secured communities,\\\" compared with 7 million a decade earlier. But rather than making residents feel safer, Low says, the intense focus on security and privacy only serves to cut them off from the public and stoke their anxieties about outsiders. Walled-off communities, by their very nature, lead to ever higher walls.\\n\\\"Indian Creek is a great extreme example of trying to pull out completely from having anything to do with the rest of the world,\\\" Low says. \\\"The more you enclose yourself, the more you're reminding yourself of a sense of risk.\\\"\\nAt a council meeting in 2022, not long after the installation of the perimeter-security system, Indian Creek residents were once again discussing the need to ramp up their security. This time, they worried the threat might be coming from inside the mansions. The police chief, John Bernardo, proposed a measure that would require any worker entering the island to submit to a criminal background check. Despite pushback from some residents who were concerned that the policy would make hiring more difficult, the council came down largely in support of the idea.\\nFor Mayor Klepach, the background checks were just a starting point.

       "   'summary': \"CNN —\\nGermany has struck a controlled migration deal with Kenya, which will see Berlin open its doors to skilled and semi-skilled Kenyan workers.\\nThe deal was signed by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Kenya's president William Ruto on Friday. Ruto landed in Germany on Friday for an official two-day visit.\\nWhile the exact number of workers that will arrive in Germany has not been disclosed, a spokesperson for Kenya's presidential office previously said it was looking at employment opportunities for up to 250,000 Kenyans.\\nMigration is a major flashpoint in Germany, and has fueled the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Germany welcomed more than one million people during the migrant crisis of 2015-2016 and more recently took in large numbers of Ukrainians fleeing Russia's invasion.\\nThe agreement comes as Scholz's government launches a crackdown on illegal immigration, recently announcing a tightening of border controls. Late last month, Berlin unveiled new security measures aimed at speeding up the deportation of rejected asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants which will begin next week.\\nAs well as deterring irregular migration, the deal is intended to address labor market needs in both countries, providing opportunities for Kenyan workers while supplementing an ageing Gemany's shortage of skilled laborers. It also intends to simplify the repatriation of Kenyans who are in Germany illegally.\\nThe two countries agreed to step up their cooperation on repatriation, with the introduction of measures such as the use of biometric data to identify those who are required to leave Germany.\\nExpired passports and identity cards will now also be accepted as travel documents to facilitate repatriation.\\nAccording to the German government, there are currently around 14,800 Kenyan citizens living in Germany. Around 800 of them are required to leave the country.\\nInterior Minister Nancy Faeser said she was 'very pleased' with the outcome.\\n'We want to consistently enforce the repatriation of people without a right to remain - this is an important building block for limiting irregular migration. We have made good agreements for this,' she said.\\n'On the other hand, we want to attract qualified workers, who we urgently need in many areas of our economy.'\\nThe German Interior Ministry adds that it is in confidential talks with several other countries regarding migration agreements.\\nThe new security package came in the wake of a fatal attack in the western city of Solingen, in which three people were stabbed to death on August 23.\\nThe suspect was identified as a 26-year-old Syrian man with alleged links to ISIS, who had previously been due for deportation.\",\n",

The competition is part of a growing wave of hobby horsing events internationally: the United States and Australia also held their first championships this year.\\nThe events stemmed from a grassroots movement in Finland, where riders trotted their hobby horses through Nordic forests more than 20 years ago. The pastime has since exploded in popularity through social media during the height of the coronavirus pandemic, and it has been credited with highlighting female empowerment for the enthusiasts.\\nAdvertisement\\nArticle continues below this ad\\nJulia Mikkonen, head of the Finnish Hobbyhorse Association, said hobby horsing combines Finnish handcrafting culture — some riders make and decorate their own sticks and stuffed horse heads — with gymnastics and sport.\\nIn Germany, the national hobby horsing association was established a year ago with just 13 members. Now there are more than 5,000 active athletes and more than 200 clubs across the country.\\n\\'It was very important to us to set an example and make the sport more popular,\\' said Kay Schumann, president of the German Hobby Horsing Association. \"With the championship, which will be held every year from now on, we offer a goal that motivates hobby horsers to improve their performance and compete against each other.\"\\nWhile organizers want to promote empowerment and acceptance through a positive and inclusive experience for competitors, critics have pounced on the activity. Many riders have faced bullying and misogynistic comments online. Other detractors say the pursuit is not a sport.\\nAdvertisement\\nArticle continues below this ad\\nMikkonen countered that just like in other sports, hobby horse riders need athleticism, strong core muscles and stamina to succeed.\\nCompetitors in Germany this weekend will be judged on factors including precision, timing and elegance, according to the German Hobby Horsing Association\\'s website. Judges will award marks in the style and dressage contests, and the highest score wins.\\nFor dressage, officials will be looking at the rider\\'s posture, skills and body positioning. Are they using elegant leg movements, with their toes touching the ground first? Are they using various speeds and gaits in their routine?\\nStyle jumpers will also be judged on their posture, as well as jumping over the center of the obstacles, sticking the landing and keeping a steady pace.\\nAdvertisement\\nArticle continues below this ad\\nSchumann said children and young riders brought hobby horsing to Germany through social media. They swapped videos and images with each other, and built a community around the shared interest.\\n\\'It spread like wildfire,\\' he added.\\n__\\nAdvertisement\\nArticle continues below this ad\\nDazio reported from Berlin.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"Karim Adeyemi celebrates the first of two goals against Bundesliga leaders Heidenheim. (Photo by ... [+] Alexandre Simoes/Borussia Dortmund via Getty Images)\\nBorussia Dortmund forward Karim Adeyemi hasn't been called up to the Germany squad since the 2022 World Cup. Indeed, with Germany having regained their former strength under Julian Nagelsmann, it is difficult to imagine Adeyemi being called up any time soon.\\nFor a while, Adeyemi seemed to take this personally. In November, Adeyemi refused a call-up to the U21 Germany national team. According to some reports, this might have been the final nail in the coffin for the Dortmund forward to be left out of the Euro 2024 squad.\\nPart of the story too is that Adeyemi didn't warrant a call-up based on his performances with Dortmund last season. Indeed, Adeyemi managed just six goals and six assists in 24 Bundesliga games for Dortmund this season.\\nThe start to this season, however, indicates that Adeyemi might have taken Nagelsmann's snub ahead of the Euros to heart. Under new head coach Nuri Sahin, Adeyemi is given a more central role, and the forward has accepted a call-up to the U21 Germany team ahead of the European Championship games against Israel and Estonia.\\nIn those two games, Adeyemi was Germany's best player. The 22-year-old scored twice in the 5-1 win over Israel and three times in the 10-1 win against Estonia.\\nMore importantly, Adeyemi then managed to carry over the form to Dortmund. On Friday, the striker was the best player in the Black and Yellow's 4-2 win over league leaders Heidenheim.\\n'I am listening!' Karim Adeyemi (r.) celebrates the second of his two goals for Borussia Dortmund ... [+] against Heidenheim. (Photo by)\\nFirst, the Munich-born forward assisted Donyell for the opening goal (11'), then Adeyemi doubled the lead in the 17th minute. Heidenheim would pull one back in the 39th minute when Marvin Pieringer scored with a header. But Adeyemi restored the balance two minutes later when he made it 3-1 for Dortmund. Both teams would then exchange goals in the second half, but ultimately, Dortmund would carry the day.\\n'We played a good game,' Adeyemi would say to German broadcaster DAZN after the game. 'The two goals against us were unnecessary. But for me personally, I carried the confidence I gained playing at the U21. It is something that really helped me in this game.'\\nAdeyemi then also credited Dortmund head coach Sahin. 'The coach trusted me, and I, in turn, showed him that he can count on me,' Adeyemi said. 'I am very happy about the two goals, and sort of hoped that I could add a third. But ultimately, the three points are more important.'\\nWith seven goals across three games for club and country, Adeyemi is in excellent form. Of course, we have been here before, as Adeyemi has been able to provide flashes of brilliance only to be interrupted by stretches in which he was either out of form or injured.\\nIn fact, conserving this form will be key if Adeyemi wants to make his way back into Nagelsmann's notebook. The Germany senior team has been in excellent form, and Nagelsmann has cultivated a significant amount of depth. Furthermore, Adeyemi isn't the only winger pushing, as Heidenheim's forward Paul Wanner might be an option sooner rather than later for Nagelsmann.\\nIn other words, Germany has the depth now to overlook players who are not at the very top level. Ultimately, that could be good news for Dortmund, as they might finally get to experience the player they hoped they would get when they signed Adeyemi from RB Salzburg for €30 million ($33.2 million) two years ago.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"GÖRLITZ, Germany—When the Cold War ended, European governments slashed their military budgets and spent a windfall of several trillion dollars on social programs—a popular policy with voters when Europe faced few external threats and enjoyed the security protection of the U.S.\\nNow, European nations are finding it difficult to give up those peacetime benefits, even as the war in Ukraine has revived Cold War-era tensions and the U.S. tries to shift its focus to China. Most are failing to get their armies in fighting shape.\\nThe lesson: It was easy to swap guns for butter; reversing the trend is far more challenging.\\nThat means—despite promises to raise military spending—defense ministers say they are struggling to get what they need. In Germany, Europe's largest economy, military bases are crumbling or have been converted to civilian use, including sports centers, old people's homes and pension fund offices. The army, which numbered half a million in West Germany and 300,000 in East Germany during the Cold War, has today just 180,000. It now has a few hundred operational tanks, compared with more than 2,000 Leopard 2 main battle tanks its West German predecessor had in the late 1980s.\\n'That's frustrating to me,' German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius told journalists recently, after getting much less than he had requested for next year's military spending. 'It means there are certain things I can't do at the pace that…the level of threat requires.'\\nIt is also likely to frustrate U.S. hopes that Europe will finally begin relieving some of the burden from Washington, which accounts for two-thirds of military spending among North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies. Both U.S. presidential candidates have said they want Europe to shoulder more of its security costs.\\nIf Donald Trump wins in November, the call for Europe to do so would likely grow louder. Trump said in February the U.S. wouldn't defend allies that don't meet NATO's minimum target of spending 2% of gross domestic product on their militaries, saying Russia could 'do whatever the hell they want' with those that missed the target. In recent days, he said allies should be spending 3%—matching U.S. levels.\\nFew European nations, with the exception of Poland or the Baltic states, are close to spending 3% of GDP on their militaries. The U.K. had vowed, under the previous Conservative government, to raise military spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2030 from about 2.3%. But new Prime Minister Keir Starmer has refused to put a date on it. Military spending in Italy and Spain, meanwhile, sits under 1.5%.\\nAt the current pace of rearmament, it would take Germany 100 years to return its artillery howitzer stockpiles to their 2004 levels, according to a report published earlier this month by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, an independent think tank.\\nDuring negotiations for Germany's 2025 budget earlier this year, Finance Minister Christian Lindner wanted to free up money for defense by freezing social spending for three years—letting it lag inflation. The move was rebuffed by other parties in the governing coalition, and the underlying defense budget was increased by just 1.2 billion euros, equivalent to around $1.3 billion, compared with 2024—just enough to cover the latest pay hike for military personnel. Spending on military aid for Ukraine was cut to €4 billion, about half this year's level.\\nWhat the coalition parties did agree on was a €108-a-year increase over two years in Kindergeld—an annual €3,000 payment per child to all families, regardless of income. Today, that benefit alone, payable for offspring up to age 25, costs more than €50 billion a year, as much as Berlin's annual Defense Ministry budget.\\n'The idea—we are dismantling the welfare state because we need more money for the military—I would find fatal,' said Economic Affairs Minister Robert Habeck.\\nHabeck argued that Germany not only faced an external threat from Russia, but an internal threat from people getting disillusioned with democracy—a jab at the ascendant far-right AfD party.\\n'Social spending is necessary to keep the country together,' said Habeck.\\nIn the mid-1980s, West German military spending stood at around 3% of GDP and over 5% in East Germany. In 2022, the now-unified country spent around 1.4%. As a result, the country saved a total of €680 billion that was put toward rebuilding the formerly communist East and extending the welfare state there, according to Ifo, a Munich think tank. Europe as a whole has saved about €1.8 trillion since 1991 by spending less than 2% of GDP on its armed forces, Ifo calculates.\\nThe meticulously restored town of Görlitz in Germany's far southeast, a setting for Hollywood movies such as 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' and 'Inglourious Basterds,' shows the fruits of the country's peace dividend.\\nIn baroque town squares, pensioners sip flat whites. Students study free of charge at an airy, revamped university campus overlooking the river. The train station is being refurbished, a central square remodeled and the local hospital is building a new wing for the elderly.\\nThe town also shows why politicians are leery of swapping butter for guns, economists' term for the trade-offs states must make when choosing between military and social spending. With an elderly population and weak economy, the city receives the second highest regional transfers of taxpayer money in the form of subsidies and welfare benefits of any German district. Even so, spending pledges by the central government are straining the resources of Görlitz, which shoulders some of the costs, including support for children, said district administrator Stephan Meyer.\\nThe district received a €40 million bailout late last year from the state government to cover a budget deficit. Meyer said he expects the gap between revenues and expenditures to grow to around €100 million by 2028.\\n'Everybody understands that we are at a very special juncture. The question is where will the money come from,' said Christian Mölling, a defense expert and director of the Europe program at the Bertelsmann Foundation in Berlin.\\nDays after Russian President Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz promised a 'Zeitenwende,' or turning point. He pledged Berlin would raise military spending above 2% of GDP, and unveiled a special €100 billion off-budget investment fund for rearmament. Military experts welcomed the move, but warned the 2% threshold wasn't enough to strengthen the military quickly given Germany's chronic underspending.\\nTwo years later, however, Germany's underlying defense budget sits at 1.3% of GDP, and overall military spending is only meeting the 2% threshold thanks to the off-budget investment fund. When that runs out in 2028, Germany will have to hike its underlying defense budget by 60% that year to keep it above 2%—which analysts say is unlikely.\\nNot including the special fund, the share of the underlying defense budget that goes into procuring new weapons and ammunition has fallen from €10 billion in 2022 to €3 billion this year, according to Hans-Peter Bartels, president of the German Society for Security Policy, an armed forces lobby organization. The rest goes mainly to personnel, maintenance, training and building costs.\\n'The Zeitenwende has failed,' said Benjamin Tallis, a senior fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations, calling the effort to rearm Germany 'too little, too slow, too uncertain.'\\nThe country's public social safety net, meanwhile, totaled €1.25 trillion last year, an eye-popping 27% of GDP—higher than Denmark and Sweden and compared with around 23% for the U.S. in 2022, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\\nGovernment officials counter by pointing to the rearmament fund and say strict budget rules mean Germany can't borrow to spend more and cutting welfare risks endangering public support for Ukraine.\\nEconomists say there are many welfare measures that could be pared back to beef up military spending. A heavily subsidized €49-a-month ticket that gives access to public transport and regional trains nationwide costs the state €3 billion a year. Another €5 billion goes for training the unemployed despite an economy that is close to full employment, says Moritz Schularick, president of the Kiel Institute.\\nStates such as Saxony, where Görlitz is located, offer additional perks, such as tens of thousands of dollars in subsidies for families who want to purchase their first home, and subsidized vacations for low-income families.\\nRaising Germany's military spending to 3% of GDP would require finding an extra €40 billion a year, equivalent to France's entire annual defense budget. A study by Mölling and colleagues published this month estimates that plugging the gap in Germany's defenses by 2030 would cost €103 billion.\\n'I'm not sure [cutting welfare spending] is the solution,' said Michael Kretschmer, the conservative governor of Saxony, where Görlitz is located, saying the country needs to spend more on defense, but also on schools, infrastructures, and other items. 'I think what we need is an economy that grows faster.'\\nUpstart political parties, such as the AfD, have been betting that there is little appetite among the public for increasing military spending. The party won the eastern German state of Thuringia and almost won in Saxony state elections on Sept. 1—in part by pledging new benefits such as free school meals, while promising to seek reductions in military spending.\\n'Ukraine and refugees are more important than school food?' said Mike Moncsek, an AfD member of the German Parliament from Saxony.\\nThe new far left BSW party also scored well in the election by promising butter over guns. 'We don't want to prepare for war, we want to prepare for peace,' said Zaklin Nastic, the party's defense policy expert in parliament. 'And above all, we need to preserve social peace here in Germany.'\\nMeanwhile, military projects have faced local opposition. Last summer, not far from Görlitz, hundreds of protesters and local politicians from the far right and far left protested close to a disused air base where Manfred von Richthofen, the World War I flying ace known as the Red Baron, once trained.\\nThe protesters wanted to block the country's leading arms manufacturer, Rheinmetall, from building a new ammunition factory on the site that would supply Ukraine and restock German stockpiles. Many feared the factory could become a target of Russia. Within weeks, the company said it would add capacity to an existing plant in Bavaria instead.\\nNorth of the city lies one of the largest military training grounds in Germany. Görlitz Mayor Octavian Ursu would like to expand the facility, but local politicians are opposing the move.\\n'Residents complain that too much is being done for Ukraine,' Ursu said.\\nWrite to Tom Fairless at tom.fairless@wsj.com and Bertrand Benoit at bertrand.benoit@wsj.com\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'September is a crucial month that could determine if Tesla can claw back recent losses in Europe or whether rivals like BMW can hold onto their gains.',\n",
       "   'summary': \"The research published by JATO Dynamics at the end of last month ought to have hit Elon Musk like a ton of bricks: Tesla is falling behind its competitors in Europe.\\nBMW took the crown as Europe's leading brand for fully electric vehicles for the first time ever in July, driven by demand for its all new iX2 compact crossover. According JATO's figures, the German premium carmaker sold nearly 14,900 cars in the month powered solely by battery, 300 more than Tesla as volumes for the Model Y dropped off steeply.\\nInitial data signaling August hasn't been any kinder to Musk in Europe's largest individual markets. Sales in France fell by half over last year's month, while in Germany they plunged by two-thirds. While the loss of subsidies and new tariffs on Model 3 sedans imported from China contributed to that poor result, industry analysts fear Tesla is now paying the price for pushing a stale portfolio of vehicles into a stagnant European EV market where consumers are spoiled for choice.\\nPwC analyst Steven van Arsdale, himself a Model Y owner, argues Tesla must soon launch new smaller vehicles practical for Europe's cramped spaces and winding, narrow roads. Otherwise they risk losing more ground.\\n'There's some weakness in their armor,' he tells Fortune . 'It's surprising they've done as well as they have, but it will be hard to continue to grow volume without having something in the lower segments.'\\nThe car market is typically divided up into slices based on vehicle size, starting with minicars like the Fiat 500, before graduating to a subcompact like the Renault Clio, the larger Volkswagen Golf compact, the Tesla Model Y mid-size, and so on. These classes usually are referred to as letters, with the 500 starting in the A-segment and the Y as a D-segment, for example.\\n'Europe has traditionally always been really a B and C-segment heavy,' says von Arsdale, 'so the D-segment where Tesla operates is just not the bread and butter of the market.'\\nMatthias Schmidt, a Germany-based EV industry analyst and publisher of a monthly industry report, cautions not to read too much into the figures—at least not yet—since July and August are seasonally among the weakest as people go on holiday.\\nThat's why this month will prove so crucial. Not only are consumers back from vacation, September is traditionally one of the two strongest car sales months in the lucrative UK market thanks to semi-annual plate change that is similar to a new model year designation in the U.S..\\nIf sales don't show a sharp outperformance versus its EV peers this month, it is a clear indication that Tesla has deeper problems in Europe that only fresh new product can solve.\\n'Musk is beginning to realize Tesla needs different models in different segments,' says Schmidt. 'Their range doesn't have a very good spread.'\\nThe EU electric-vehicle market is far deeper and more diverse in its offering than in the U.S., since carmakers on the continent must sell a certain number to avoid draconian fines if they fail to reduce their vehicles' carbon emissions.\\nNext year the EU raises the bar, meaning the continent's carmakers will be more incentivized than ever to try and move their less profitable EVs lest they face steep penalties.\\nIt isn't helping either that Musk is giving his traditional demographic of affluent progressives plenty of cause to eyeball his competitors' offerings. Last month the Tesla CEO egged on UK race riots with divisive and incendiary language and even spread fabricated news on social media that prompted outrage in the country.\\nWhether triggered by his comments or not, Tesla volumes in August plummeted by a full quarter in the UK last month. This time however, Tesla can't blame this on a declining overall market for EVs.\\nUnlike Germany for example, the UK has been a real bright spot in Europe. EV sales in the country recorded their best performance since December 2022, with registrations up 11% over last year's period, accounting for roughly every fourth new vehicle sold.\\nFortunately, some key competitors are leaving the door ajar for Tesla to come back, should it indeed launch new models in Europe in the coming months.\\nVolkswagen Group once challenged Tesla for leadership of the global EV market, but enthusiasm for the technology at its Wolfsburg headquarters has notably waned after a number of products have disappointed. VW is now facing historic job cuts and plant closures.\\n'The transformation is indeed proceeding more slowly than many experts predicted years ago,' VW Group CEO Oliver Blume told German business daily Handelsblatt last week.\\nVolkswagen is not the only one revising its plans. This month, Scandinavian carmaker Volvo scrapped its target to only sell EVs starting in 2030. That means Tesla can expect less EV investment and therefor likely less strenuous competition from legacy brands in Europe.\\nThis leaves the Chinese as the greatest longer-term threats to Tesla in Europe. But surprisingly they are struggling to make inroads.\\nTake Germany, still the largest market for electric vehicles in Europe despite the recent slump. The only Chinese-built electric vehicle of note is the MG4 hatchback with more than 10,000 sold through August. That's no coincidence: The MG badge is a storied UK brand known in Europe with an existing dealer network. Another popular option is Smart, a Mercedes brand that's now operated jointly with new partner Geely, which imports from China.\\nBy comparison, native Chinese brands that lack a legacy distribution network are performing poorly. The BYD Seal, a popular Tesla Model 3 competitor in China, has sold just 400 cars in Germany in the first eight months of this year.\\nPwC Autofact's van Arsdale believes there's plenty of chances for Tesla to claw back market share by offering a smaller vehicle at a cheaper entry price. He cited the substitution of more expensive features and materials for cheaper versions as one possibility, or eliminating them altogether. Tesla already applied this process, known as decontenting, earlier this year in the Mexican market, using cloth fabric on their seats.\\nHe's less convinced, however, that Tesla's Full Self-Driving software, which automates many of the driving functions, could help it gain new buyers if it is indeed approved for use in Europe early next year.\\n'it seems to me they still have a long ways to go to get the system working in Europe,' he says.\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': \"Read here for an analysis of the stake build-up in Commerzbank and UniCredit's distribution policy and highlights on higher costs and litigation concerns.\",\n",
       "   'summary': \"In our last UniCredit (OTCPK:UNCFF, OTCPK:UNCRY) analysis, here at the Lab, we emphasized a clear upside in the M&A. Combined with an attractive capital return and a solid balance sheet, the leading Italian bank was a clear buy opportunity. No sooner said than done, the Group communicated the acquisition of a 9% equity stake in Commerzbank (OTCPK:CRZBF) (OTCPK:CRZBY). 4.51% was acquired on the market, while 4.49% was bought in the accelerated book building launched by the German government for €13.2 per share. Considering a €702 million investment, we positively value this add-on with potential synergies ahead. The operation would be immediately accretive regarding profits projection, with a limited capital impact on UniCredit CET 1 ratio evolution. In addition, the Italian group also submitted a request to the EU regulator to obtain authorization to increase its stake above 9.9% (there is a 30% equity stake threshold for a full takeover). According to the press release, the company is guiding 15 basis points of capital impact with no changes in the current distribution policy. This is due to the company's ample capital buffers, which in Q2 reached 16.2% compared to a regulatory requirement set at a minimum of 7% (4.5% as a percentage of risk-weighted assets +2.5% of capital conservation buffer). This report provides our view on the deal and the latest Commerzbank Q2 update.\\nCommerzbank Deal\\nAs a reminder, UniCredit already has a significant presence in Germany (Fig 1). HypoVereinsBank accounts for 22% of the total company's sales, and there is also a complementary investment banking business. Considering that, the combined entity would rank first in revenues in the German lending market, ahead of Deutsche Bank. According to our calculation, combining the two German businesses would imply approximately €550 billion in assets. The combined budget will also have circa €350 billion in loan book and approximately €400 in deposit, with a market share of 10%. Looking at the details, Commerzbank is bigger than UniCredit German bank (loans of €225 billion vs. €130 billion. The company is also more balanced between retail and corporate; however, it is much less efficient. In detail, Commerzbank has a cost/income ratio of 60% (Fig 3), while UCG Germany stands at < 45%. On an aggregate basis, in a full bid scenario, Germany's weight for UniCredit would rise to 40% from the current level of approximately 20-25%.\\nRunning preliminary numbers for a potential complete acquisition, these are our key takeaways:\\nUniCredit has balance sheet optionality to complete the deal. In our numbers, the company would potentially reach a 13% CET 1 ratio with an ample margin of safety;\\nThe company could generate solid EPS accretion, even with limited synergies. This would exacerbate the Commerzbank stock's attractive valuation angle. The Italian bank's price-to-tangible book ratio now stands around 1.05x, compared to Commerzbank's around 0.5x. Predicting a 20% majority premium, and considering that Commerzbank has a profitability (RoTE of 8%) compared to over 17% for UniCredit, we might expect a potential 15% upside in the current UniCredit EPS estimates.\\nSource: UniCredit Q2 results presentation - Fig 1\\nCommerzbank Q2 results\\nLooking at the Q2 2024 results (Fig 2), the company reported:\\nSales of €2.7 billion, with solid contributions from all the business;\\nOperating result to €2.0 billion in the semester;\\nAnd a CET1 ratio of 14.8%.\\nIn the details, there is a 24% loan loss provision and a 5% increase in Commerzbank's OpEx guidance. Thirdly, there is a pending litigation concern about the mBank CHF mortgage. On the loan volume, there was a 9% decline in consumer lending, which was offset by corporate clients, which delivered a plus 3% on a quarterly basis and a plus 5% on a yearly comparison. The German mortgage business was stable, but there is a continued shift from sight deposits to call money. This might decrease the NII evolution. That said, the company reiterated the Fiscal Year 2024 NII guidance of around €8.1 billion (Fig 3). While volume growth and loan loss provision are temporary concerns, we believe that OpEx outlook and litigation might trigger future profitability and distributions. The company needs to show effective cost control, considering cost and wage inflation. This might result in a pre-tax consensus downgrade. On the downside, the bank booked €240 million for the CHF litigation and confirmed the total litigation provisions below €1.1 billion. The bank CET 1 ratio is vital. Despite the NII decline due to a normalized interest rate environment and a P&L drag from mBank CHF mortgage litigation, we are below the bank's net income projection. That said, before the UniCredit acquisition, the bank was trading at a P/E of 5.7x (2025) with a P/TNAV of 0.5x. This is well below EU bank peers with a P/E of 7x and a P/TNAV between 0.8/1x.\\nSource: Commerzbank's Q2 results presentation - Fig 2\\nFig 3\\nValuation & Risks\\nStarting positively, ECB President Christine Lagarde is open to EU bank consolidation and expresses favorable words. UniCredit trades at a P/E of 6.4x in 2025, with a P/TBV of 0.9x. Here at the Lab, we expect severe scrutiny, which includes Commerzbank's potential stake build-up and a problematic situation in Germany given the difficult juncture of its economic cycle. Even if our initial view of the deal is positive and the company already operates in the country, we have made no changes to our valuation methodology. Our buy is reiterated with a valuation of €38.55 per share. Including a complete merger and valuing the combined entity with UniCredit current multiple might result in a significant upside opportunity (with a target price of almost €52 per share).\\nConclusion\\nHere at the Lab, we are not speculating on an OPA from UniCredit. There are many downsides to consider. That said, the Italian company is still a buy on a standalone basis. In our previous analysis, there was a risk section; today, we include M&A execution risks, changes in taxation, and potential litigation. In addition, a deal with Commerzbank also needs a favor from the German Union.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"At least four people have died, thousands of homes have been damaged and hundreds have been evacuated after some of the heaviest rain in years hit central and eastern Europe.\\nA slow-moving low pressure system dubbed Storm Boris dumped a month's worth of rain onto several of Europe's historic capitals, including Vienna, Bratislava and Prague.\\nFour people have died in Romania, where the rainfall left hundreds stranded in flooded areas. Rescue services have been launched in hard-hit counties as authorities warn that they have recorded the heaviest rainfall in 100 years over the past 24 hours.\\n'The effects were most critical in seven localities,' Romania's Interior Minister Cătălin Predoiu told CNN affiliate Antena 3. 'They have already intervened there to save 95 people. Sadly four people have been found dead in their houses or yards.'\\nRivers burst their banks in Poland and the Czech Republic. In Poland's south, authorities ordered the evacuation of residences in the town of Glucholazy. The level of the river Biala Glicholaska rose by two meters, or 6.5 feet, overnight into Saturday.\\nAfter a difficult night and hundreds of incidents reported Poland's Interior Minister, Tomasz Siemoniak told TVN24 they were 'focusing on what the threats will be in the next few hours.'\\nSignificant flooding is expected to continue in the Czech Republic, where authorities have ordered mandatory evacuations for some areas. Footage released by the Czech Republic Fire and Rescue Service showed flooded streets in the southern Benešově nad Černou municipality, where two women who didn't follow evacuation orders had to be rescued by boat.\\nIn Germany, southern and eastern states in particular are preparing for flooding. Flood warnings have been issued for rivers in the state of Saxony. In neighboring Austria, heavy rainfall has caused water levels to rise in several rivers, leading to rescue services being called out to parts of the country overnight.\\nWidespread and significant flooding is expected to continue through the weekend.\\nRed alerts, the highest level of warning, have been issued for portions of Poland, Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria and Slovakia. This level of alert is associated with 'intense meteorological phenomena' and 'major damage is likely,' according to Meteoalarm.\\nCNN meteorologists Taylor Ward, Allison Chinchar, and Elliana Hebert contributed to this report.\\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\",\n",

The bodies were found in the localities of Pechea, Draguseni, Costache Negri, and Corod, the Department for Emergency Situations said without providing details on how they died.\\nEmergency authorities released video footage that showed a team of rescuers evacuating an elderly man on a small lifeboat before carrying him to safety.\\nA Black Hawk helicopter was deployed to Galati to help with the search and rescue missions.\\nThe storms battered 19 localities in eight counties in Romania, with strong winds downing dozens of trees that damaged cars and blocked roads and traffic. Authorities sent text message alerts to residents to warn them of adverse weather as emergency services rushed to remove floodwaters from homes. Some roads have also been closed.\\nRomania's Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu canceled planned engagements Saturday to travel to Galati county to assess the fallout. 'The Prime Minister will discuss with the local authorities the urgent intervention and support measures for the population and communities severely affected by the floods,' his office said.\\nThe stormy weather comes as several central European nations anticipate severe flooding forecast to hit the Czech Republic, Poland, Austria, Germany, Slovakia, and Hungary over the weekend.\\nMeteorologists say a low-pressure system from northern Italy was predicted to dump much rainfall in most parts of the Czech Republic, including the capital and border regions with Austria and Germany in the south, and Poland in the north.\\n'We have to be ready for worst-case scenarios,' Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said after the government's central crisis committee met. 'A tough weekend is ahead of us.'\\nIn Poland, Prime Minister Donald Tusk also traveled on Friday to the southwestern Polish city of Wrocław where floods are forecast. Authorities appealed to residents to stock up on food and to prepare for power outages by charging power banks.\\nThe weather change arrived following a hot start to September in the region, including in Romania. Scientists have documented Earth's hottest summer, breaking a record set just one year ago.\\n___\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': \"'In football you have to win, that's clear,' Erik ten Hag admitted while the Manchester United manager has defended Matthijs de Ligt's poor form\",\n",
       "   'summary': \"Erik ten Hag accepts that if Manchester United's poor results continue the backing offered by the club's executive will fade, with the manager admitting: 'You have to deliver.'\\nIn their past two games United have lost 2-1 at Brighton and 3-0 to Liverpool. The chief executive, Omar Berrada, and sporting director, Dan Ashworth, supported Ten Hag when speaking before the Liverpool game. 'We think Erik is the right coach for us and we're fully backing him,' Berrada said.\\nIt was put to Ten Hag that this stance may alter if results do not improve. He concurred, stating his contentment with high expectations and that they have a shared vision.\\n'In football you have to win, you have to deliver, that's clear,' he said. 'It's good that the new leadership acknowledges this and says this. We are working together to be more successful – we have higher targets than we've already achieved.'\\nThe Dutchman was asked about his stance that the club remain in transition despite this being his third season in charge. 'It's not only to do with me,' he said. 'Nobody can deny in these last eight or nine months a lot has happened – new leadership team, structure, ownership structure, a new leadership.'\\nTen Hag is under pressure to guide United to victory over Southampton in Saturday's early match but he has no fear that Matthijs de Ligt's poor form for the Netherlands is an issue. De Ligt, bought from Bayern Munich this summer for £38.6m, was taken off at half-time of the 2-2 draw with Germany on Tuesday.\\nThe coach, Ronald Koeman, said this was to 'protect' De Ligt after an erroneous pass allowed Deniz Undav's equaliser and a fluffed clearance led to Joshua Kimmich giving Germany the lead. Three days before, De Ligt made mistakes in the 5-2 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina.\\nTen Hag was asked about Koeman's comment. 'He said it in reference to the Dutch squad, not a club situation,' he said. 'I know Matt and he's a great personality. He will overcome this and will bounce back.\\n'This is definitely not his club situation. I'm not afraid of this situation. The other thing is he had a very difficult pre-season because he didn't play games. The only game from the start was against Liverpool. So he starts for the Dutch squad and is not in rhythm or up to full speed but, when he is, you will see his qualities.'\\nSign up to Football Daily\\nKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football\\nafter newsletter promotion\\nIn the 3-0 loss to Liverpool, Casemiro made two mistakes that led to goals but Ten Hag defended the holding midfielder. 'I speak with him about the situation – everyone can have a bad day at the office,' he said.\\nTen Hag has also discussed with the Brazilian the competition provided by Manuel Ugarte's signing. 'I did [as normal] but players in our club know when you are at this level there is always competition,' he said.\",\n",

A German automotive trade association says they would hurt German automakers, which have a significant presence in China. Germany has a substantial automotive trade surplus with the country. Italian and French automakers, meanwhile, have almost no presence there.\\nChina has been exporting cars to countries all around the globe, and both supporters of tariffs and trade and industry analysts point to China's support for its domestic manufacturers as a rationale for imposing tariffs.\\n'We're dealing with an economy in China where credit money is allocated by the state and not by the market, and the state picks sectors that they want to promote,' said William Reinsch, senior advisor and Scholl Chair in International Business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a bipartisan think tank in Washington, D.C.\\n'In that kind of economy — if you do that — you always get overinvestment, you always get overcapacity, you always get overproduction, and then that overproduction gets dumped on the rest of the world.'\\nChinese automakers can produce a car for about $5,500, said Felipe Muñoz, senior analyst for JATO Dynamics, while it costs European automakers closer to $20,000.\\nThat tremendous cost advantage is partially explained by government subsidies, he said.\\n'But also it's explained by higher economies of scale,' Muñoz continued. 'It's explained by lower labor costs and by the fact that when it's about electric cars, China, unlike the rest of the world, it has already secured the supply chain for the batteries.'\",\n",

They are not traditional activists but have used activism as a tool in the past.\\nWhat's happening\\nVoss has engaged with the company's board and management team regarding ways to maximize shareholder value, including a possible sale of the company in a take-private transaction.\\nBehind the scenes\\nInternational Money Express is a money remittance services provider which enables consumers to send money from the United States, Canada, Spain, Italy and Germany to Mexico, Guatemala and other countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia. The company provides its services through a network of authorized agents located in various unaffiliated retail establishments, 118 company-operated stores and digitally via an app and its website. IMXI serves more than 4 million clients every month and has a goal of connecting families across borders, ensuring financial services are accessible to those who need them most. The company has roughly 20% market share in the top five Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) markets and has been continually seeking expansion into new markets. For example, IMXI has made recent acquisitions of La Nacional in 2022, which has a strong market position in remittances to the Dominican Republic and other LAC countries. The company also acquired I-Transfer in 2023, which established outbound remittances capabilities from Spain, Italy and Germany. It also snapped up a money services entity in the United Kingdom in 2024, which will give the company the opportunity to provide outbound remittances from the UK.\\nThis is not an opportunistic activist engagement for Voss. The firm initially reported holding IMXI in its Q2 2021 13F filing when the company was trading around $15 per share and it has held the stock ever since. Now, on Sept. 5, 2024, Voss filed a 13D and reported 5.64% ownership at an average cost of $19.14 per share, purchasing shares as high as $20.09 in the past 60 days.\\nOne of the things the firm states in its 13D is that it has engaged in communications with the board and management of IMXI regarding a potential sale of the company in a take-private transaction. Voss is not the only actively engaged shareholder in the stock calling for a sale. A day prior to Voss's 13D, Breach Inlet Capital Management sent a public letter to the board of IMXI, urging them to pursue a review of strategic alternatives that includes a potential sale of the company. Breach Inlet asserts that, despite solid operating performance and increasing adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by over 2.5-times since going public six years ago, the company remains undervalued by the public markets. IMXI trades at under 5-times the last 12 months' adjusted EBITDA while its peer remittances service provider MoneyGram was acquired by private equity firm Madison Dearborn for approximately 8-times adjusted EBITDA last June. Breach Inlet thinks that IMXI should be valued at a premium to MoneyGram, not a material discount, but just an equal valuation would imply a roughly $30 per share price.\\nGlobal remittances service provision is a highly fragmented market with no single company commanding greater than 20% market share. Accordingly, there could be consolidation opportunities for IMXI with a strategic acquirer like Western Union, which also trades at a premium to IMXI. If IMXI stays independent, its growth plan of expansion into the digital and European markets would require heavy investment in people and resources, sacrificing short-term performance for long term growth. This is not the type of plan that plays well in the public markets. Instead, IMXI could be a great business to be acquired by a private equity firm that can help facilitate the company's growth plan while shielding it from the public markets, which have failed to fully value the company. You do not need to be a genius to see the allure of a company like this to private equity: A private equity firm bought it in 2007 and another one again in 2017.\\nThis is not the first time Voss is advocating for a strategic review at a portfolio company. In its 13D on Benefytt Technologies, filed in December 2019 when the stock was trading at roughly $14 per share, Voss highlighted the strategic opportunities at Benefytt and the active M&A environment in the company's space. Benefytt was acquired by Madison Dearborn Partners on Aug. 31, 2020 for $31 per share. Most recently, at Griffon, Voss called for a strategic review, which the company undertook and ultimately concluded, determining to stay independent. Despite this, Griffon was a highly successful activist campaign for Voss where the firm gained board seats and made a 139.21% return on its 13D versus 1.28% for the Russell 2000 over the same period.\\nWe strongly believe that modern day shareholder activism is a strategy that greatly benefits shareholders. We believe the best type of shareholder activism involves activists who come in with a detailed, long-term plan to create value, with a board seat being a huge plus. The other side of the spectrum is shorter-term 'sell the company' activism that is often great for the investor but shortchanges the long-term shareholder. In those situations, we like to see a longer-term 'Plan A' with a sale as a last resort or a detailed analysis on why the company cannot or should not continue as a standalone public company. While Voss does not provide either of these, the firm does have a lot of credibility as a long-term investor (an owner since 2021) who has not been public with its recommendations to management until now. As such, we think Voss's intentions here are honorable and it's doing what it thinks is best for both short-term and long-term shareholders.\\nIf the IMXI does not execute on a strategic plan, Voss will likely consider director nominations. While a proxy fight is not likely part of its current plan, the firm has been successful in gaining board representation in previous campaigns. Voss is not afraid to take a proxy fight to a vote. At Griffon, the firm ran a successful proxy fight, winning a board seat for one of its two director nominees at the 2022 annual meeting, and later settling for another board seat. There are two directors up for election at the 2025 annual meeting and the nomination window opens on Feb. 21, 2025. If it comes to a proxy fight there are multiple factors that could work in Voss's favor, including the company's depressed stock price. There have also been signs of shareholder discontent, including the roughly 31% withhold votes cast against lead independent director Michael Purcell at the 2024 annual meeting\\nKen Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments.\",\n",

The heavy rainfall continued to pummel the region into Sunday.\\nIn Poland on Sunday, one person drowned in Klodzko county and authorities advised residents of Moszczanka and Laka Prudnicka to evacuate after a dam at risk of collapse breached. In Austria the same day, a firefighter died in action, the fire department told CNN.\\nIn Romania, two more people were confirmed to have died from flooding on Sunday, following four deaths on Saturday.\\nRescuers have been working hard to rescue hundreds of people left stranded by heavy rainfall there. 'The effects were most critical in seven localities,' Romania's Interior Minister Cătălin Predoiu told Antena 3. Although teams managed to save 95 people trapped in their homes, the bodies of the dead were found in either their houses or yards, Predoiu added.\\nAround 5,400 houses have been damaged in the southeastern region of Galati which has been hardest hit by the flooding, Antena 3 reported.\\nResidents in one of the region's villages, Pechea, recounted their shock at the devastation wrought by the flooding. 'I have nothing left,' social worker Sofia Basalic told AFP, describing how the gushes of water had 'entered the house' and 'tore down the walls,' destroying her kitchen appliances and killing her farm animals.\\nFactory worker Gica Stan, whose entire house was also flooded, said he didn't even have a 'needle left' and was now relying on donated clothes.\\nRescue services have been launched in hard-hit counties as authorities warn that they have recorded the heaviest rainfall in 100 years over the past 24 hours.\\nRivers have burst their banks in Poland and the Czech Republic. In southwest Poland, 1,600 people were evacuated in Klodzko county as local rivers reached record high water levels and broke their banks.

       "   'excerpt': 'The Shenzhen A shares index, a bellwether of mainland Chinese equities, is down 32 percent from its 2-year high set in February of last year.',\n",
       "   'summary': \"da-kuk\\nDemography, deflation and debt. These are the Three Ds of China's economic lassitude, and they have all been in the news recently. International investors, meanwhile, continue to add a fourth D to the picture - departure. The Shenzhen A shares index, a bellwether of mainland Chinese equities, is down 32 percent from its 2-year high set in February of last year. And it's not just portfolio managers with their fleet-of-foot capital heading for the exits; US and European businesses with longstanding foreign direct investment in China are rethinking the dependence of their supply chains on a China that has become increasingly difficult to deal with, both economically and politically.\\nWhere Have All The Workers Gone\\nChina's demographic problems begin and end with its dependency ratio - the number of retirees relative to the working population. That number has been going up as the population ages and the birth rate, even after the end of the disastrous one child per family experiment, declines. Economists project that China will add around 20 million people to its retirement rolls each year from 2023 to 2035, straining its badly underfunded pension system. This week, the government announced its intention to raise the official retirement age for the first time since 1978, gradually extending the age for men from 60 to 63, for women in white-collar jobs from 55 to 58, and for women in blue-collar fields from 55 to 58.\\nThe Japan Syndrome\\nNo amount of tinkering with the retirement age will help China deal with a deep consumer funk that threatens its growth prospects as far ahead as the eye can see. Consumer prices are teetering on the edge of outright deflation - China's consumer price index currently sits at just 0.6 percent year-on-year, compared to the 2.5 percent headline CPI number for the US released earlier this week. Households have cut back on spending as the country's property crisis grows deeper and deeper, with little in the way of economic assistance from Beijing. China's household savings rate is an astonishing 31 percent. When the government does step in, it does so in an oblique way by pumping liquidity into the manufacturing sector, apparently in the hope that industrial production will boost exports and thus circulate money back into the domestic economy. A news article in the Financial Times this week cited a handful of economists arguing that under current conditions, China would need to spend some $1.4 trillion in stimulus outlays to put the country back on a long-term sustainable growth trend.\\nBond Bubble\\nWhen economic growth prospects look shaky, investors seek safety in fixed income markets, and China is no exception. Massive purchases of government bonds have driven the yield on the 10-year benchmark bond down to an all-time low of 2.1 percent. Banks and nonbank financial institutions have been leading the charge, giving rise to fears of a bond bubble that could decimate banks' asset quality if rates were to suddenly spike up. As they could well do, given that the total amount of new government borrowing between August and December of this year is estimated to be close to $400 billion. Xi Jinping's long-term economic strategy calls for substantial investment - meaning lots and lots of debt issuance - in leading-edge green technology to establish global dominance in what Beijing expects to be the growth drivers of the coming decades. The success of that long-term vision is anything but certain; meanwhile, the already-precarious state of the Chinese economy could unravel further still with a widespread debt crisis.\\nChina is the world's second-largest economy - in fact, it is the largest when ranked by purchasing power parity. The Chinese supercycle, which lasted from the early 1990s through the first decade of the 21st century, is the fastest growth cycle ever recorded in human history. Thus, its current economic troubles reach far beyond the shores of mainland China. The country's weakness is a key factor, for example, in the economic travails of Germany, whose usually reliable exports of high-value manufactured products languish amid weak demand from China, its biggest market (and these conditions, in turn, explain a good part of Germany's current political troubles with extreme right wing and left wing political parties winning three recently-held regional contests in the county's east).\\nMeanwhile, even with its diminished domestic equity markets, China still makes up around 25 percent of the MSCI Emerging Markets equity index. One way to understand the chronic underperformance of emerging market equities, as we have noted in commentaries over the past several years, is to understand the 3D problem of China - demography, deflation and debt - that does not appear to be going away any time soon.\\nOriginal Post\\nEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"European countries are facing challenges in competing in global markets. Former Italian Prime Minister and former ECB President Mario Draghi proposed a recovery plan that wasn't well-received by everyone.\\nIn the report, or rather in two reports by Mario Draghi, structural problems of the European Union and its member states in terms of global competition, especially with China and the USA, were highlighted. Among the issues noted were decreasing productivity, low innovation, a shortage of skilled workers, high energy prices combined with the costs of the energy transition, and the spread of unfair competition in international trade. The proposed solution was to increase investments by approximately 800 billion euros ($886 billion dollars) annually, which is about 5 percent of the EU GDP. By comparison, investments under the Marshall Plan were about 2 percent of GDP. The report also noted issues with defense and the arms industry.\\nDraghi pointed out two worrying trends. First, EU countries are keen to procure weapons and their components from outside the Community, limiting the development of the EU economy. At the same time, they are reluctant to invest in joint (and often their own) projects, weakening local R&D potential and leading to its dispersion. For example, during the period of increased defense purchases in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine (from mid-2022 to mid-2023), 63 percent of the value of defense orders were placed with the American industry and 15 percent with non-American companies outside the EU.\\nIn a similar period, EU countries allocated only 5 percent of their defense spending to R&D activities (about $11.8 billion), while in the USA, 16 percent of defense spending went to this purpose ($140 billion, several times more). The crisis is exacerbated by the fact that many countries are still avoiding meeting NATO's requirement of allocating 2 percent of GDP to defense (by the end of 2023, 9 out of 32 NATO countries had not met this requirement, most of which are EU members). Achieving this requirement by all EU countries would result in an increase in EU defense spending by about $66 billion.\\nThe report emphasized that the dispersion of organizational efforts deepens production fragmentation. For example, 10 different types of 155 mm caliber guns were sent to Ukraine, not all of which use the same ammunition. The arms industry is also said to be over-regulated, similar to many other sectors.\\nAs a remedy to this unfavorable situation, the author recommended increasing investments in R&D activities, the defense industry (within the framework of the aforementioned increased investment expenditures), and supporting European industrial integration. Draghi also proposed broader usage of the joint defense procurement mechanism and the creation of a separate position for a commissioner for the defense industry.\\nAccording to Draghi, public procurement regulations should be revised to favor EU solutions. When purchasing solutions outside the USA, a model should be sought in which many EU countries would purchase jointly to obtain better conditions, including moving production to the EU and ensuring technical support.\\nDraghi's plan as a whole is opposed by Germany, among others, who are reluctant to increase debt necessary to finance the extremely ambitious project. Skepticism regarding the discussed recovery plan for the EU enjoys cross-party agreement in Germany, whose economy is also slowing down. Regarding defense, Berlin seems to be sitting on the fence: on one hand, the interests of German arms companies are important, but on the other, where it's convenient, they prefer non-EU solutions.\\nThe plan as a whole contains many elements worth discussing. In terms of defense, it is worth agreeing with Draghi that Europe spends too little on defense, including R&D and industry development. Defense cooperation in procurement should also be developed because, despite not always good experiences, the scale of joint orders should bring numerous benefits.\\nHowever, this requires systemic solutions, including harmonizing the requirements for equipment by various armies and creating uniform procurement procedures. On the other hand, cooperation with countries outside the EU does not necessarily have to endanger the EU economy; it can even support the realization of member states' global aspirations. Examples include the British-Italian-Japanese GCAP aviation program or, if it succeeds, the Polish-Korean cooperation.\\nThe proposed integration of European defense, while potentially beneficial for the EU as a whole, also carries the risk of weakening or even eliminating smaller players in the market. While Draghi cites the USA as a positive example, Americans are currently seeking ways to rebuild smaller, more innovative companies.\\nRead also:\\nRussia leads as U.S. modernizes infrared tracking technology\\nEU reports uptick in Russian gas imports despite overall decline\\nRussia's secret plan to bypass sanctions with Indian electronics\",\n",

Whatever you want to call it, the distinctive performance style of a female gibbon is a dance, researchers say.\\nKai Caspar, a zoologist at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf in Germany, and colleagues analyzed the stylized movements of certain gibbons. They found that the key characteristics of human dance are also present in the gibbons' choreography. The findings have been posted online ahead of publication in the journal Primates.\\nGibbons are long-armed apes that live in Asian tropical forests. Dr. Caspar became interested in their dancing when he was trying to learn how gibbons in zoos responded to a mirror. The apes didn't show recognition of their reflections — but they did show off their moves.\\n'The body becomes stiff, and then these robot-dance-like movements commence,' Dr. Caspar said.\\nEarlier research had described hundreds of dances by four wild female gibbons in China. The gibbons were living in groups that each had two females but only one adult male. Peering up into the treetops, the researchers saw the females seeming to use dance to solicit their male's attention. That male sometimes reacted to dances by grooming the female, or mating with her.\\nTo study dances in more gibbon species, Dr. Caspar teamed up with Camille Coye, a primatologist at the Institut Jean Nicod in Paris, and Pritty Patel-Grosz, a linguistics professor at the University of Oslo who studies dance and gesture.\\nDr. Patel-Grosz said they defined dance as an intentional movement that's rhythmic and doesn't serve a physical purpose, like walking or scratching an itch does.\\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

I'm not afraid for this situation, I know his qualities, I know his personality and I know he'll fight back.\\n'The other thing is he had a very difficult pre-season because he didn't play games.

       "   'excerpt': \"Shocking Blue's manager Cees van Leeuwen, an overbearing man, was one reason for the premature ending of the Dutch band, and its limited success ('Venus') in America.\",\n",
       "   'summary': \"4-3-2-1 Hot and Sweet, Musiksendung, Deutschland 1970, Gaststar: niederländische Band Shocking Blue.\\nOf the four members of the Dutch classic rock group, Shocking Blue, just one is still with us: lead guitarist and chief songwriter Robbie van Leeuwen, 79. The band was a sensation worldwide, with hits like 'Venus,' 'Never Marry A Railroad Man' and 'Send Me A Postcard.' Curiously, though, only 'Venus' made it big in America.\\nRecently I wrote two stories about Shocking Blue (links below), but most of my research for them was from secondary sources. Here, I was able to search out, and reach Dick Bakker, 77, the group's original sound engineer and co-producer, for some firsthand information.\\nBakker is a lot more than just Shocking Blue. He has worked for more than half-a-century in the music business, mostly classical and not just rock. In 1974, he launched the Dick Bakker Orchestra, then worked in England with The London Philharmonic. Bakker was also musical director for Metropole Orkest in The Netherlands for many years. An excellent book about his life, Behind The Scenes Of Music,' was published in 2016. Following are edited excerpts from a conversation with Bakker.\\nDick Bakker's Dick Bakker Orchestra celebrates its 50-year anniversary this year.\\nJim Clash: All bands have points of contention, some which ultimately lead to their demise. What was it in Shocking Blue?\\nDick Bakker: Shocking Blue had a manager named Cees van Leeuwen (no relation to Robbie van Leeuwen). He had a domineering personality and interfered with everything. It was very unpleasant to work with him. Robbie was a very calm and friendly guy who was eager to get the best out of his compositions with my help. I always supported him, trying to achieve the best sound. I would sometimes make musical adjustments and arrange extra instruments where necessary to create the best final product.\\nClash: How about Mariska Veres? Many in America liken her to Grace Slick of Jefferson Airplane, but without the extracurricular wild lifestyle.\\n(Eingeschränkte Rechte für bestimmte redaktionelle Kunden in Deutschland. Limited rights for specific editorial clients in Germany.) Mariska Veres (Shocking Blue). Bei TV-Auftritt. (Photo by ARTCO-Berlin/ullstein bild via Getty Images)\\nBakker: Mariska was a very kind and sweet singer who did her utmost to achieve the best. However, if something went wrong, Cees would make incredibly nasty remarks like, 'Stupid bitch, sing it properly!' We all found that horrible. Mariska was a beautiful woman, and, if I recall correctly, had a relationship with Shocking Blue's road manager.\\nClash: How were Shocking Blue's songs recorded back then?\\nBakker: The recordings were usually done quickly. At that time, we used two or four tracks, so everything had to be done right the first time. I worked extensively with special compressors and EQ to get the best result. Mariska always sang very well, and the vocals were recorded separately from the band. The long list of hits can be found on my website under 'Hit Files, Single Hits.'\\nShocking Blue's No. 1 single in America, circa late 1960s.\\nClash: 'Venus' was the big hit in America, of course. What are your memories of recording that particular song so many decades ago?\\nBakker: When the mix of 'Venus' was finished and everyone happily went home, I received a call from Cees a few days later. He said the mix wasn't good and had to be redone: 'It sounds like crap!' Unfortunately, or fortunately, the master tape had already been sent to America and was in production. When 'Venus' reached No. 1, Cees said in every subsequent production that it had to sound like 'Venus.' Apparently, he had forgotten that he didn't like that original mix!\\nClash: The band broke up in 1975. What did Mariska end up doing?\\nBakker: Yes, in 1975, the group did break up. In 1979, they tried to work together again, but it didn't really succeed. After two years, they stopped. I wasn't involved in that reunion. In 1993, Mariska performed again with a new lineup of Shocking Blue, but without Robbie. She also performed with the band The Clacks, made up of members from the well-known Dutch pop group Golden Earring. She continued performing until her passing [from cancer] in 1996.\\n(GERMANY OUT) Shocking Blue - Musikgruppe, Rockmusik, Niederlande - Mariska Veres (center left), Robbie van Leeuwen (far right), Klaasje van der Wal (far left) und Cornelius 'Cor' van der Beek (center right) (Reihenfolge unklar) - 01.09.1969 (Photo by Peter Timm\\\\ullstein bild via Getty Images)\\nClash: How was it working with Shocking Blue's excellent bassist, Klaasje van der Wal, and drummer, Cor van der Beek? The latter had a substance-abuse problem as I understand it. Did that ever manifest itself in the recording studio?\\nBakker: During the time I worked with Shocking Blue, Cor and Klaasje were always very professional and focused. There were no drugs or heavy drinking. We were all focused on creating the best possible final product. I often worked with Robbie on musical adjustments to make the songs more beautiful and commercial. Promotion in America suffered from poor management. Otherwise, they would have had more hits there.\",\n",

Guardiola does not expect to have Ake available until after the October international break, which would mean missing seven matches, including games versus Arsenal and Inter in the Champions League.\\nBobb will also miss those matches and more after having surgery on a fractured bone in his leg before the season started. Guardiola said three to four months out in mid-August, which could coincide with the November international break or extend further than that into December.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"InterCure Ltd. INCR has shown resilience in its H1 2024 performance despite facing significant challenges, according to equity research by Pablo Zuanic of Zuanic & Associates. The company reported revenues of 126 million NIS ($33.97 million), surpassing the estimated 121 million NIS.\\nHowever, this is still below pre-October 2023 levels of 414 million NIS, mainly due to the ongoing disruption at its southern Israeli facility, which has been occupied by the IDF. The company invested heavily in restoring this facility and expects it to return to full operational capacity in the coming quarters.\\nCash Reserves Plummet: Government Compensation Boosts EBITDA\\nInterCure reported an EBITDA of 17.6 million NIS for H1 2024, compared to the 5 million NIS estimate. However, this includes government compensation for damages caused by the conflict, which makes comparisons difficult.\\nThe company ended June with 21 million NIS in cash, down from 111 million NIS in December 2023. Additionally, Zuanic noted the net debt increased from 60 million NIS to 112 million NIS over the same period, although the company has access to an unused credit line of over 22 million NIS.\\nDouble-Digit Growth On The Horizon\\nLooking ahead, InterCure is guiding for double-digit sales growth in H2 2024, with revenues expected to reach around 140 million NIS, lower than previous estimates of 180 million NIS.\\nThe company's expansion strategy includes launching more than 30 new GMP SKUs in collaboration with brands such as Cookies, Binske and Organigram OGI. InterCure plans to introduce Cookies products in Germany by Q4 2024, in addition to ongoing sales in the UK.\\nStock Performance And Valuation\\nThe stock has experienced a drop from its May 2024 peak of $3.12 to $1.97. Despite the decline, Zuanic notes that the company's valuation remains attractive, with the stock trading at 1x sales and 8x EBITDA for CY25.\\nInterCure's enterprise value is currently estimated by Zuanic at $132 million, including $96 million in market capitalization and $36 million in net debt.\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'A billionaire investor who predicted the global financial crisis has warned that the US election risks tipping the world\\'s biggest economy into serious disorder.In a week when candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump finally faced each other in a televised debate, Ray Dalio said his biggest fear was for democracy no matter who wins on 4 November.Mr Dalio founded the world\\'s largest hedge fund and is closely-watched by other investors for his stock-picks.In an interview with the BBC, he said: \\'There\\'s a possibility that the loser, particularly if it\\'s the Republicans and Donald Trump, might not accept losing and you have a situation where it\\'s a win-at-all-cost by both the left and the right, so neither side can compromise.\\'My great fear is for democracy,\\' he said.Regardless of the victor, Mr Dalio said he expected there to be internal migration between states based on political, economic and moral dividing lines.\\'A lot of people in states like California and New York and New Jersey and so on, will go to states like Florida and Texas, partially because of taxes, but partially because of values,\\' he said. \\'There\\'s a big gap in values\\'.\\n\\'This reminds me of the 1930 to 45 period in which there was an economic crisis followed by democracies becoming dictatorships. Germany, Italy, Spain and Japan had parliamentary systems, and they broke down in terms of internal conflict between the the hard left, the hard right, communism and fascism. We are today seeing modern day versions of some of these things\\', he said.There is some evidence that US migration based on values is already happening. Elon Musk announced in July he would move the headquarters of his companies X and SpaceX from California to Texas citing new rules banning schools from notifying parents that children wanted their gender redefined.Dalio, now 75, is the founder of Bridgewater Associates - the world\\'s largest hedge fund with $124bn in assets . He says he thought the probability of civil war was \"low, but cannot be dismissed.\\'\\nDalio, mercifully, does not claim he is infallible. But he insists he is more often right than wrong.\\'He who lives by the crystal ball is destined to eat ground glass. But I\\'ve been right in the markets about 65% of the time\\', he said.But on the most immediate question in the US he is hedging his bets and refuses to be drawn on whether he thinks Trump or Harris will win.\\'I do not know how this election is going to turn out and how these things will turn out. I do know that we have an exceptionally high probability of instability\\', he concluded.',\n",

That was the first time Xabi Alonso's title-winning team had lost in the Bundesliga for 15 months.\\nBoniface set up Martin Terrier for Leverkusen's first goal and scored himself soon after, beating defender Alexander Prass and leaving him sprawled on the ground and he scored past goalkeeper Oliver Baumann.\\nLeverkusen's three games in the league this season have seen a combined 15 goals scored, in part because of lapses in concentration in defense that have frustrated coach Alonso.\\nMergim Berisha's goal for Hoffenheim in the 37th minute cut Leverkusen's lead to 2-1 and Alonso's team nearly conceded another soon after. However, Leverkusen took control again after the break and a penalty from Florian Wirtz and another goal from Boniface ensured a 4-1 win.\\nIt was the first time Boniface had scored twice in a game since an adductor muscle injury ruled the Nigerian striker out of much of the second half of last season as Leverkusen won the title.\\nKeeper denies Leipzig\\nUnion goalkeeper Frederik Ronnow frustrated Leipzig in a goalless draw, saving a penalty from Loïs Openda and a stoppage-time free kick from David Raum.

       "   'summary': \"Keir Starmer and Joe Biden have discussed letting Ukraine fire long-range, western-supplied missiles into Russia, while stopping short of any formal announcement. Vladimir Putin has threatened it would amount to Nato joining the war. The UK prime minister told reporters at the White House that he had a 'wide-ranging discussion about strategy' with the US president but that it was not just a meeting about 'a particular capability'.\\nBefore the meeting, officials had said Starmer would press Biden to back his plan to let British Storm Shadow be used to strike inside Russia. Britain's PM indicated he and Biden would discuss the plan at the UN general assembly in New York the week after next 'with a wider group of individuals'.\\nBiden dismissed Vladimir Putin's sabre-rattling threats, saying he did not accept that Ukraine using Storm Shadows missiles against Russia proper would amount to Nato going to war with Moscow, reports Dan Sabbagh in Washington. 'I do not think much about Vladimir Putin,' Biden said.\\nMoscow's ambassador to the UN told the security council on Friday that loosening the missile strike restrictions would mark an escalation to 'direct war' between Moscow and Nato. Washington officials accused Putin of trying to scare Nato countries away from supporting Ukraine, reports Andrew Roth. In Europe, leaders played down Putin's threats. The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said: 'I would not attach excessive importance to the latest statements from President Putin. They rather show the difficult situation the Russians have on the front.'\\nZelenskiy said the Ukrainian incursion into Russia's border region of Kursk had produced the desired result of slowing Moscow's advance on another front in Ukraine's east. The Ukrainian president said in Kyiv on Friday that Russia's counterattack in Kursk produced no major successes – contradicting Vladimir Putin's accounts of Russian advances on both fronts. Zelenskiy said Russia had about 40,000 troops on the Kursk front. 'So far we have seen no serious [Russian] success.' Russia's defence ministry said on Friday its troops had taken back 10 villages out of 100 that Kyiv had occupied. The battlefield reports of either side were not able to be independently verified.\\nThe Ukrainian general staff said on Friday that Russian forces had focused their assaults near the town of Kurakhove, about 33km (20 miles) south of the key logistics hub of Pokrovsk in Ukraine's Donetsk region. Russia's defence ministry said its forces had captured Dolynivka, positioned between Pokrovsk and Kurakhove, the latest in a series of localities Moscow says it has seized.\\nVolodymyr Zelenskiy said 49 Ukrainian prisoners of war had been returned from Russia, with Agence France-Presse witnessing the group being greeted at the border with Belarus. The Ukrainian president did not clarify whether it was part of an exchange with Russia, as is usually the case, but AFP journalists had earlier seen Russian prisoners of war being loaded on to a bus near the border.\\nRomania started training its first group of Ukrainian F-16 pilots this week, the Nato country's defence ministry said. The first four pilots had started their 'theoretical training', a ministry spokesperson told AFP, with practical training to follow 'towards the end of the year'.\\nDrone fragments fell on a municipal building in Kyiv's Obolon district north of the city centre early on Saturday, said the mayor. Writing on Telegram, Vitali Klitschko said no fire broke out and emergency services were sent. He earlier said air defence units had been in action. A Reuters witness said explosions were heard. The head of Kyiv's military administration, Serhiy Popko, urged people to remain in shelters as drones still posed a threat. The air raid alert was later lifted for the city but remained in effect for several regions of central Ukraine.\\nRussia announced it had revoked the accreditation of six British diplomats in Moscow on accusations of espionage. Moscow's FSB domestic spy agency said on Friday that it acted on documents showing part of the UK Foreign Office was helping coordinate what it called 'the escalation of the political and military situation' in Ukraine. The Foreign Office, however, said the move had been made last month as part of a continuing diplomatic tit-for-tat. Sources indicated the British diplomats had left Russia weeks ago and were already being replaced.\\nThe US has imposed new sanctions on Russia over its role to 'undermine democracies', the US secretary of state said. 'The actions we're exposing today and the actions we exposed last week do not incorporate the full scope of Russia's efforts to undermine democracies,' Antony Blinken said. 'Far from it.'\\nVolodymyr Zelenskiy said he would meet Joe Biden 'this month' to present his 'victory plan' on how to end the war with Russia. The Ukrainian leader gave no details on how to end more than 30 months of fighting, saying only that his proposal would involve 'a system of interconnected solutions that will give Ukraine enough power – enough to put this war on a course to peace'.\\nThe German chancellor has said he will not send long-range missiles requested by Ukraine. Germany possesses powerful Taurus cruise missiles. Olaf Scholz said on Friday: 'Germany has made a clear decision about what we will do and what we will not do. This decision will not change.'\\nBoris Johnson met with Zelenskiy in Kyiv and renewed calls for permission for Storm Shadow strikes on Russia aimed at 'stopping the appalling Russian attacks with glide bombs and now Iranian missiles'. Zelenskiy also met with The American actor Michael Douglas and his son Dylan in Kyiv. The Ukrainian president said that they, alongside Ukraine's first lady, Olena Zelenska, discussed 'the situation in our country, cooperation with partners, support for Ukraine, and the fourth Summit of Ladies and Gentlemen'.\\nUkraine's government has approved a 2025 draft budget with a strong focus on defence spending, the prime minister said. Denys Shmyhal said on Friday that the draft, to be submitted to parliament, provided for 2tn hryvnias (US$48.2bn) in revenues and 3.6tn hryvnias in expenditures. The draft also included a provision of 2.22tn hryvnias (US$53.5bn) for defence. 'The priority for this budget is very clear – the country's defence and security,' he said. 'We will again direct all domestic resources to these objectives.'\",\n",

Germany, Italy, Spain and Japan had parliamentary systems, and they broke down in terms of internal conflict between the the hard left, the hard right, communism and fascism. We are today seeing modern day versions of some of these things\\', he said.\\nThere is some evidence that US migration based on values is already happening. Elon Musk announced in July he would move the headquarters of his companies X and SpaceX from California to Texas citing new rules banning schools from notifying parents that children wanted their gender redefined.\\nDalio, now 75, is the founder of Bridgewater Associates - the world\\'s largest hedge fund with $124bn in assets .

       "   'summary': 'It might sound like a wind up, but a group of scientists have discovered that some mammals like mice, pigs and rats can breath through their bottoms!Their cheeky discovery has led them to be awarded one of this year\\'s Ig Nobel Prizes.The annual awards look at the funny side of science and have been taking place for more than thirty years. Keep reading to find out some of this year\\'s other winners and let us know your favourite in the comments.\\nWhat is the Ig Nobel Prize?\\nThe Ig Nobel Prize awards are presented every year by a US science humour magazine. They celebrate unusual experiments; ones which might make people laugh as well as think.The \\'Igs\\' - as they\\'re known - are a light-hearted alternative to the world famous Nobel Prize awards.The Nobel Prize are awarded each year to a group or individual who has made a big contribution in one of several categories - Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics, and Physiology or Medicine.Lots of famous people have won a Nobel Prize, including Albert Einstein, Mother Teresa and Martin Luther King.So, the Ig Nobels aren\\'t real Nobel Prizes, but they are still important prizes for science.A lot of research goes into experiments and some help with real problems in the world.There are 10 Ig award categories which included medicine, biology and probability.\\nWho were some of the 2024 Ig Nobel Prize winners?\\nThe Physiology Prize (the study of how the human body works) went to an international team of Japanese and US researchers for discovering that many mammals can breathe through their bottoms.They said they were inspired by loach fishes, which are capable of breathing through their intestines. The team found that many mammals, including mice, pigs and rats, can absorb oxygen (which is the gas that our lungs absorb when we breathe in) when it is delivered through their bottoms!The scientists said their findings suggested that in the future, guts could also be used as an \"accessory breathing organ.\"An international team of scientists led by academics in Germany picked up the Ig Nobel Prize for Probability, which involved the team flipping more than 350,000 coins! They found that when people flip a coin it \"wobbles\" in the air, making it slightly more likely to land on the same side it started.The experiment was carried out over 81 days, using 44 different currencies.Lead researcher Frantisek Bartos explained that it was \"fun to do some stupid stuff from time to time.\"Other Ig Nobel winners included scientists in France who investigated whether hair on the heads of people in the northern hemisphere swirled in the same direction as those from the south.They found that while the hair whorls of most people swirl clockwise (left to right) - in the southern hemisphere, counter-clockwise whorls are more common!',\n",

       "   'summary': \"Billionaire investor and founder of Bridgewater Associates Ray Dalio warns that the US election could cause chaos if the loser, especially Donald Trump, refuses to concede, resulting in a cutthroat all-or-nothing approach from both sides.\\nIn a recent interview with the BBC, Dalio highlighted that many people from states such as California, New York, and New Jersey are likely to move to states like Florida and Texas, driven partly by tax considerations and partly by differing values.\\n'My great fear is for democracy,' Dalio told BBC.\\nIn an interview with the Financial Times earlier this year, Dalio suggested that the chance of a civil conflict in the U.S. could be as high as 40%, reflecting his serious worries about the nation's current state. He clarified that this civil war wouldn't involve physical violence but rather an intensification of political polarization.\\nIn this scenario, individuals would relocate to states that better align with their values and ignore federal decisions made by opposing political factions, as he explained to the Financial Times.\\nDuring a week marked by the televised debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, Dalio expressed his deep concern for the future of democracy, regardless of the outcome on November 4.\\n'This reminds me of the 1930 to '45 period in which there was an economic crisis followed by democracies becoming dictatorships,' Dalio told BBC.\\nDalio noted that Germany, Italy, Spain, and Japan experienced the breakdown of their parliamentary systems due to internal conflicts among the far left, far right, communism, and fascism, and he observed that modern versions of these issues are currently emerging.\\nAccording to a December Gallup survey, only 28% of US adults are currently satisfied with how democracy functions in the country, marking a new low compared to the previous low of 35% recorded shortly after the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack. Satisfaction levels vary significantly between political affiliations, with 38% of Democrats and just 17% of Republicans expressing contentment. Additionally, those with less formal education tend to be less satisfied with the state of democracy.\\n'I do not know how this election is going to turn out and how these things will turn out. I do know that we have an exceptionally high probability of instability', Dalio informed the BBC.\\nWhy Dalio's Views Are Significant?\\nThere is some indication that migration in the US based on personal values is already underway, as predicted by Dalio. For instance, in July, Elon Musk declared his decision to relocate the headquarters of his companies, X and SpaceX, from California to Texas, BBC added.\\nMusk cited new regulations in California that prohibit schools from informing parents if their children wish to change their gender identity as a key reason for the move.\\nReflecting on his predictive track record, Dalio told the BBC, 'I've been right in the markets about 65% of the time.'\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Manchester City are top of the league, obviously. Pep Guardiola's side have won their first three Premier League games this season, obviously. Erling Haaland is on fire, obviously.\\nThe Norwegian striker already has seven goals this season, including a pair of hat-tricks. All is well at the Etihad and, like the Terminator, they absolutely will not stop.\\nBrentford, less predictably, are also going well in the early stages of the season. One might have expected the departure of Ivan Toney for pastures new to have caused issues for Thomas Frank's side but they've won two and lost just the match against Liverpool, the only side other than City with a 100 per cent record this term.\\nAdded to this, somewhat surprisingly, Brentford are the last away team to have won at the Etihad in any competition. That victory came back in November 2022 and, since that loss, City have won 38 games and drawn seven at home.\\nCity will be without Nathan Ake after he picked up an ankle injury on international duty while representing the Netherlands against Germany. Rodri has yet to play for the champions this season, but seems likely to return after featuring in Spain's 4-1 Nations League win over Switzerland last weekend. Joshua Dasilva, Rico Henry, Igor Thiago and Aaron Hickey are all on Brentford's injury list although there is the possibility of Kristoffer Ajer's foot problem clearing up in time for the trip to City.\\nIt was confirmed on Friday that the hearing into Manchester City's 115 charges will begin on Monday so that will undoubtedly be an unwelcome distraction for Guardiola and his players (though they're invariably going to insist otherwise). Added to this is the news of Mikel Arteta agreeing a new deal at Arsenal and suddenly things seem a little calmer for City's main title contenders the last couple of years than they do in the blue half of Manchester. Manchester City vs Brentford odds\\nOdds updated as of 8 p.m. BST Friday. Man City win: 1/5 (-500)\\n1/5 (-500) Draw: 13/2 (+650)\\n13/2 (+650) Brentford win: 23/2 (+1150)\\nVenue: Etihad Stadium — Manchester\\nTime: 3 p.m. BST (10 a.m. ET), Saturday Form guide\\nManchester City: 3-0-0, 9 points (1st); W-W-W\\nBrentford: 2-0-1, 6 points (6th); W-L-W Match prediction\\nManchester City 2-0 Brentford\\nThey say lightning doesn't strike twice and, while it's not scientifically accurate, there is a certain metaphorical truth to the adage. It's hard to see Brentford winning at the Etihad again, especially since Toney scored a brace that day. A comfortable home win seems much more likely so let's go with 2-0.\\n(Photo of Erling Haaland: Henry Nicholls / AFP via Getty Images)\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'A Northern Ireland football team whose players received life-changing organ donations has taken part in their first world cup.The Transplant Football World Cup was held over the last week in Cervia, Italy, with 11 teams and 180 players.Orla Smyth, one of the joint managers of the Northern Ireland team, said it was a good opportunity to meet people who have had similar experiences as organ donor recipients.\\'It\\'s competitive football, but none of us would be alive and playing if it wasn\\'t for our donors, and that\\'s a big element of appreciation,\\' she said.\\nThe tournament began last Sunday with the teams split into two groups. The structure of the games involves seven-a-side teams playing fifteen-minute halves.The rules mirror those of a standard football game and group competition. The only difference is there are two referees, and players are not allowed to have contact.Orla said playing sport had been ruled out previously because of the risk involved for patients after their transplants. However, specialists later decided that the risk was \\'minimal\\'.\\'They\\'ve adapted the rules a little bit so that transplant recipients feel more comfortable getting into playing post-transplant.\\'\\n\\'I thought I\\'d never play again\\'\\nThe team formed in the last year when organisers went on a recruitment drive around hospitals in Northern Ireland.\\'It\\'s getting the word out there to get people back into the sport so they can keep themselves fit and well physically and mentally,\\' she said.One of the players who found out about the team while in hospital was Mark Hughes.Mark had a kidney transplant 17 months ago and was handed a leaflet about transplant sports while recovering.\\'I thought, \\'Why not get involved?\\' I think it\\'s good because you get to meet people who are in the same circumstances as you,\" he said.Since finding out about transplant sports, Mark has competed at the British Transplant Games and was also in Italy for the football world cup.Mark said he had a lot to reflect on after the team played their final game in Italy.\\'Just over a year ago, I thought I would never play football again, so to get that opportunity made me quite emotional. So onwards and upwards. We\\'re building for the future.\\'\\nNorthern Ireland faced Spain, Australia, America, and Chile in the group stages of the World Cup in Italy.The team did not make it to the next stage, but Mark said that has not deterred them.\\'We have only been together a short time, and these teams have probably been together for years. So for us, it\\'s like a building process; we\\'ll get bigger and we\\'ll get stronger,\\' said Mark.Another special element for the players is that one of the referees, Arlene Campbell, is also from Northern Ireland and is a living donor.\\nThe team have returned to Northern Ireland and are setting their sights on the world transplant games in Germany next year, as well as preparing for the next transplant football contest in 2026.\\'It gives us two years to prepare and to really properly form the football team,\\' said Orla.With only four women out of 180 participants competing at this year\\'s cup, Orla wants to see a drive for more women to take part.\\'It would be very difficult to get an all Northern Irish female football team, but I would like to think there\\'d be an international element for female footballers from all around the world to come together and just play football,\" she said.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"Hopes for a big rate cut from the Federal Reserve next week got suddenly revived, sending the Dow near an all-time high.\\nStock and bond traders ramped up bets on Friday that the Fed could slash interest rates by 50 basis points — or half a percentage point — after the Wall Street Journal reported that central bankers have become increasingly focused on the health of the US job market versus inflation.\\nThe Dow was recently up 287 points to 41,384 — not far off its Aug. 30 record of 41,563.\\nAfter practically writing off the chance of a 50-basis-point cut earlier this week, traders in swaps markets most recently were predicting a 47% chance that Fed officials could opt for a bumper cut at a policy meeting next week.\\nStill, in what it is expected to be the first lowering of rates since 2020, a thin majority of 53% chance are forecasting the more typical rate cut of 25 basis points on the central bank's current key lending rate of 5.25% to 5.5%.\\n'A couple of articles were published in the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times suggesting that a 50-bps move was still in play, which has led markets to once again reevaluate their expectations,' Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note to clients.\\nFormer Federal Reserve chair Bill Dudley said on Friday there was 'a strong case' for the larger cut at a forum in Singapore.\\n'I know what I'd be pushing for,' said Dudley, who led the New York Fed until 2018. 'The question is why don't you just get started? It's basically up to Chairman Powell to see how much support he has for being more aggressive.'\\nBob Savage, head of markets strategy at BNY Mellon, said that investors want the Fed 'to ease fast and get on with the risk of recession fighting.'\\nThe reportedly planned cut comes after August's lower-than-expected lab our market numbers in which there were 142,000 jobs created.\\n'The time has come for policy to adjust,' Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in his keynote speech at the Fed's annual economic conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming last month. 'The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.'\\nA cut in interest rates would lower borrowing costs for American households by making repayments on credit cards and home loans cheaper.\\nThat, in turn, could also potentially encourage customers to spend and businesses to invest in a move that would boost the US economy less than two months before the election amid fears of a possible recession.\\nInflation – the price rise in key goods – appears to have been tamed in recent months after the Fed kept interest rates unchanged for the past 14 months.\\nIn August, consumer prices rose 2.5% ahead of November's presidential vote where the cost of living is expected to be one of the major issues as Americans head to the polls.\\nThat is down from its recent peak of 9.1% in June 2022 when governments worldwide were dealing with the fallout from the global coronavirus pandemic.\\nUBS's Brian Rose, senior US economist, wrote in a note that 'the inflation data has been good enough to allow the Fed to start cutting rates in September, but does not give them a reason to cut aggressively.'\\n'If the Fed does 25, not 50 bps, investors will need to reconsider some of the more optimistic cyclical rally or no recession narratives,' said Arnim Holzer, Global Macro Strategist at Easterly EAB Risk Solutions.\\nThe Fed would be joining a global rate cut cycle after the European Central Bank, which sets rates for the 20-nation single currency eurozone, announced its second rate cut on Thursday in three months.\\nECB officials in Frankfurt, Germany pointed to slowing inflation and stronger economic growth as the reasons for the cut in interest rates.\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'Several beaches are right at our doorstep whenever we fancy a walk, a swim, or a surf, and there are hiking trails all around us. We built this life centered on freedom. A rigid schedule does not dictate our work, and we certainly don\\'t have to plan our trips around any school holidays.\\nOur kid-free life is great\\nBesides feeding our two cats, we don\\'t have to get out of bed on a Sunday morning, especially when the cool Atlantic breeze is blowing. Sometimes, there\\'s a heavy mist lingering, creating a cozy vibe, perfect for a day spent binge-watching Netflix on our unstained couch.\\nWhile we\\'re both happy with our decision not to have kids today, we weren\\'t always on the same page regarding this topic. I seesawed between \\'yes\\' and \\'no\\' for several years, not quite knowing if kids were something I wanted or something everyone else wanted for me. Though my husband didn\\'t want kids, he also never pushed me either way, which I\\'m grateful for.\\nThe circle of friends we\\'ve been cultivating since moving to Portugal\\'s coast in 2018 has been growing each year. It mostly consists of other childless couples (or couples with grown-up children), surfers, business owners and freelancers, and expats from countries like Germany, Poland, France, Venezuela, and Spain.\\nI started questioning things after a couple we know had a baby\\nRecently, though, our perfectly crafted child-free lifestyle has been turned upside down. A couple we\\'re close with has had a baby. Though we haven\\'t spent time with them and their baby yet, my anxious mind instantly started painting a dire picture: Fun lunches, boozy dinners, grownup activities, and meetups would be replaced by a whole lot of baby talk, diaper changes, and high-pitched background noises.\\nWhile this thought makes me clench my jaw muscles, it has also unearthed a question — or rather, an avalanche of questions.\\nAre we making a mistake by not having children? Did we miss something when designing our child-free life? Will we regret our decision to live on our own terms without the chaos and beauty of raising a child? Is this really the life we want?\\nThe life we created for ourselves is undoubtedly an incredibly privileged one, but the fundamental question our friends\\' decision has stirred up is, \"Are the two of us going to be enough for the rest of our lives?\"\\nI\\'m not exactly sure whether it\\'s just FOMO rearing its head or if there is something else beneath this superficial feeling of missing out on the \\'baby experience\\' — something more profound that will haunt us later in life and fill us with regret.\\nI\\'m picturing my husband and me — all shriveled up and gray — sitting at an empty dinner table, just the two of us. Maybe there\\'s a dog or two. Maybe some cats, but no offspring. No grown-up child of ours with their own family filling the empty seats around the table.\\nIt\\'s the fear of ending up alone that\\'s being triggered in me by this recent baby event. Maybe the fear of growing old alone motivates many to have children. But is it a good enough reason? And does being childless automatically mean that we\\'re going to be lonely when we\\'re old?\\nI haven\\'t shared these newly triggered fears with my husband (yet). However, knowing him, I suspect the picture I painted of us — old and gray, yet still together with a bunch of beloved pets — is his greatest hope, not his greatest fear.\\nWe can\\'t predict the future and know how we\\'re going to feel about our decisions down the line, but one thing has become clear to me: It\\'s important to life a life that feels authentic to you. If that life includes children, then go for it. If it doesn\\'t, don\\'t be afraid to choose a different path.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"The Biden administration accused Russia's global TV network RT on Friday of carrying out covert information warfare operations around the world as an arm of Moscow's spy agencies, including raising funds to buy weapons for Russian forces waging war against Ukraine.\\nCiting declassified intelligence, U.S. officials announced new sanctions against Russian state media and said the administration was launching a diplomatic effort to inform foreign partners about RT, the state-funded outlet that they said had secretly pushed out propaganda through media sites in South America, Europe and Africa while hiding the Kremlin's fingerprints.\\n'RT wants its new covert intelligence capabilities, like its longstanding propaganda and disinformation efforts, to remain hidden,' Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters. 'Our most powerful antidote to Russia's lies is the truth. It's shining a bright light on what the Kremlin is trying to do under the cover of darkness,' he said.\\nLast week, the administration focused on Russia's alleged efforts to meddle in the U.S. election and undermine support for Ukraine, unveiling indictments, sanctions and other measures to counter what it called Moscow's aggressive campaign to shape politics and sow divisions in America. On Friday, State Department officials sought to highlight Russia's information operations around the world.\\nJames Rubin, coordinator for the State Department's Global Engagement Center, said RT was much more than a state-funded media outlet — 'a fully fledged member of the intelligence apparatus and operation of the Russian government' for the war in Ukraine.\\nRT now has a cyberintelligence unit embedded in the organization with ties to Russian spy services and has used a crowdfunding platform to secure weaponry and other support for Russian forces waging war against Ukraine, Rubin and other officials said.\\n'A large online crowdfunding platform operating within the quasi-intelligence, state-funded RT and through social media channels is providing material support and weaponry to Russia's military units in Ukraine,' including sniper rifles, body armor night-vision goggles, drones, radio gear and diesel generators, the State Department said in a statement. Some of the equipment came from China, including reconnaissance drones, it said.\\nThrough proxy media outlets that purport to be independent, Russia is disseminating information to back its invasion of Ukraine, officials said. Using front companies and other intelligence tactics, RT covertly recruits and pays social media personalities to churn out content that hides Russia's involvement, officials said.\\nRT's propaganda and 'disinformation' has helped undercut international support for Ukraine, Rubin said.\\n'One of the reasons, not the only reason, but one of the reasons why so much of the world has not been as fully supportive of Ukraine as you would think they would be, given that Russia has invaded Ukraine and violated rule number one of the international system, it's because of the broad scope and reach of RT, where propaganda, disinformation and lies are spread to millions, if not billions of people around the world.'\\nIn Africa, RT allegedly is behind an online platform called 'African Stream' but hides its role, officials said. In Germany, RT secretly runs a Berlin-based English-language site known as 'Red' and in France, RT hired a journalist in Paris to carry out 'influence projects' aimed at a French-speaking audience, according to U.S. officials.\\nIn Argentina, the U.S. accused Russia of being engaged 'in operations meant to destabilize the government of Argentina and escalate tensions between Argentina and its neighbors,' the State Department statement said.\\nThe Biden administration is imposing sanctions on a state-funded broadcaster that oversees the RT outlet, TV-Novosti, another state media company, Rossiya Segodnya, and its director Dmitry Kiselyov, officials said.\\nThe state media groups Segodnya and Novosti, working with the Russian government, allegedly have planned to foment unrest in Moldova and interfere in that country's upcoming presidential election, officials said.\\nRussian state-funded media was also targeted for sanctions for allegedly funneling money into Moldova under the guise of humanitarian aid 'to buy votes to influence the upcoming Moldovan elections,' officials said.\\nRussia has previously denied running information operations to interfere in America's elections or in other country's politics.\\nRussia's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com\",\n",

Dell and Palantir were two of the largest companies not in the S&P 500, with $72 billion and $68 billion market caps, respectively.

Workday is a leading software provider, Apollo a big alternative asset manager, like KKR and Blackstone, and insurer and annuity provider. Blackstone joined in 2023; KKR in July.\\nMarvell Technology ($57 billion) may take longer. S&P requires generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, cumulative profits over the most recent four quarters and during the latest quarter. The chip maker, like many tech companies, is profitable based on non-GAAP earnings that add back stock compensation to earnings, but not on a GAAP basis, which treats stock comp as an expense.\\nCoinbase Global, Trade Desk, and Ferguson Enterprises are also candidates.

       "   'summary': \"CNN —\\nThere isn't much green in the Sahara Desert, but after an unusual influx of rain, the color can be seen from space creeping into parts of one of the driest places in the world.\\nSatellites recently captured plant life blooming in parts of the typically arid southern Sahara after storms moved there when they shouldn't. It has also caused catastrophic flooding. And scientists say a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution is making both more likely.\\nRainfall north of the equator in Africa typically increases from July through September as the West African Monsoon kicks into gear.\\nThe phenomenon is marked by an increase in stormy weather that erupts when moist, tropical air from near the equator meets hot, dry air from the northern portion of the continent. The focus for this stormy weather – known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone – shifts north of the equator in the Northern Hemisphere's summer months. Much of it sags south of the equator during the Southern Hemisphere's warm months.\\nBut since at least mid-July, this zone has shifted farther north than it typically should, sending storms into the southern Sahara, including portions of Niger, Chad, Sudan and even as far north as Libya, according to data from NOAA's Climate Prediction Center.\\nAs a result, these portions of the Sahara Desert are anywhere from twice as wet to more than six times wetter than they should be.\\nThere are two potential causes for this strange shift north, according to Karsten Haustein, a climate researcher at Leipzig University in Germany.\\nThe transition from El Niño to La Niña has influenced how far north this zone has moved this summer Haustein said. El Niño – a natural climate pattern marked by warmer than average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific – typically leads to drier than normal conditions in the wet portions of West and Central Africa. La Niña, or even a budding one, can have the opposite effect.\\nA warming world is the other significant factor.\\n'The Intertropical Convergence Zone, which is the reason for (Africa's) greening, moves farther north the warmer the world gets,' Haustein explained. 'At least, this is what most models suggest.'\\nA study published in the journal Nature this June found farther northward shifts in this zone could happen more frequently in the next couple decades as carbon dioxide – a byproduct of fossil fuel pollution – levels increase and the world warms.\\nA devastating sign of things to come\\nThe shift isn't just turning deserts green, it has disrupted the Atlantic hurricane season and had major consequences over the past few months for several African countries.\\nCountries that should be getting more rainfall are getting less as storms shift north. Parts of Nigeria and Cameroon typically get drenched with at least 20 to 30 inches of rain from July to September, but have only received between 50 and 80% of their typical rain since mid-July, according to CPC data.\\nFarther north, typically drier areas, including parts of Niger, Chad, Sudan, Libya and southern Egypt have received more than 400% of their typical rainfall since mid-July, according to CPC data.\\nTake the northern portion of Chad, which is part of the Sahara Desert. Only up to an inch of rain typically falls here from about mid-July to early September. But anywhere from 3 to 8 inches of rain has fallen in the same timeframe this year, according to CPC data.\\nThis excessive rainfall caused devastating flooding in Chad. Nearly 1.5 million people have been impacted and at least 340 have been killed by flooding in the country this summer, according to a United Nations briefing.\\nHorrific flooding has also killed more than 220 people and displaced hundreds of thousands in Nigeria, mainly in the typically drier northern portion of the country, CNN previously reported.\\nDeadly flooding also rocked Sudan in late August, killing at least 132 people and destroying more than 12,000 homes.\\nFlooding events like these likely have the fingerprints of climate change, according to Haustein, who works on attribution studies to determine to what extent climate change has influenced a particular weather event.\\nAs the world warms, it will be able to hold more moisture, Haustien explained. This could lead to wetter overall monsoons and more devastating flooding like this season.\\nMore research will be needed to determine just how much of role climate change played in each flooding event, but it could be a sign of things to come, Haustien said.\\n'Every single event is affected by climate change,' Haustein said. '(Even if) no single flood is (directly) caused by climate change, it has been made more likely.'\",\n",

[+] Art/Getty Images)\\nWorld War II did not just pick up from where World War I left off—it completely changed modern warfare, military strategies and the global order. The Treaty of Versailles and other unresolved issues from the First World War may have laid some foundation for the conflict, but the Second World War expanded its scope and left a lasting mark on international diplomacy, technology and human rights. Because of this impact, World War II has been memorialized in many works of literature and adaptations, including everything from war fiction and memoirs to biographies, military history and speculative fiction, inspiring writers across genres and countless war movies. Some of the most notable World War II works include William Shirer\\'s The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, Stephen Ambrose\\'s Band of Brothers, and Kristin Hannah\\'s The Nightingale. On this list, I have compiled 20 books that everyone should read to understand the world\\'s deadliest war better, and these rankings are based on public reception, cultural impact and longevity. Each work offers a different structure and understanding of a time in history and gives context to the experiences of those who lived through the war—soldiers on the front lines, civilians enduring the home front and leaders—whether visionary or Machiavellian— strategically tackling diplomatic challenges.\\nWorld War II is one of the most complicated wars in history and understanding the sheer scope of how the war affected people can feel understandably overwhelming. In this book, acclaimed American Civil War historian and academic Frank E. Vandiver breaks the complex pieces down into bite-sized chunks, giving readers a more straightforward way to comprehend parts of the war that changed the 20th century and continues to affect world order. Vandiver\\'s approach to this book is holistic, chronological and enriched with a global perspective that covers the war\\'s strategies, technologies and social influences.

After the Third Reich spread across Europe, Winston Churchill and his chief of staff came up with a controversial plan: to form a new commando unit made up of Jewish refugees who had escaped to Britain. This heroic unit, which would become known as X Troop, was composed of visionaries, artists, and athletes—many of whom had interned as enemy aliens. Garrett\\'s detailed research draws from extensive archival research, including declassified military documents, war diaries, and interviews with surviving members and their families adds a rich backdrop to this account.\\nWho should read this?: Readers who are interested in underreported World War II stories.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Harper Collins Publishers.\\nDunnigan and Nofi\\'s Dirty Little Secrets of World War II is an expose of the unknown secrets and strategies that informed the strategic decisions behind the war. The book primarily focuses on introduces snippets of information about the war called \"infobytes,\" which emphasize the lesser-known parts of the war. In writing this book, Dunnigan and Nofi also approach the Second World War from an interrogative perspective created to give readers a new outlook on the war, including high-tech inventions like electronic warfare and nuclear missiles. Overall, Dunnigan and Nofi\\'s collaboration contextualizes a lot of detail for the average reader in a way that conventional history books often overlook.\\nWho should read this?: This book is a good read for history buffs who want to have a deeper understanding of the war, especially those interested in the hidden strategies and technological innovations that influenced the outcome of the war.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Barnes & Noble.\\nRay Monk\\'s biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer gives insight into the keen mind of the mysterious, often caustic theoretical physicist and his role in The Manhattan Project, a research and development program undertaken during World War II that would produce the first nuclear weapons that would forever alter the 20th century. This memoir is not simply a flat retelling of historical facts; instead, it surveys the web of scientific ambition, ethical dilemma and personal affliction that defined Oppenheimer\\'s contribution to developing nuclear energy during and after World War II and the high stakes that came along with creating the atomic bomb. Monk\\'s A Life Inside The Center focuses on Oppenheimer\\'s internal conflict as a man proud of his scientific achievements but also struggling with the guilt of the atomic bomb\\'s consequences.\\nWho should read: Readers who are fascinated with brilliant protagonists battling with moral dilemmas and unintended consequences.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Penguin Random House.\\nFew leaders in the 20th century have conjured as much global condemnation as Adolf Hitler, and Ian Kershaw\\'s Hitler 1936-1945: Nemesis offers a paralleled view into Hitler, specifically from his most dictatorial years and ultimate demise. Kershaw\\'s inquiry into Hitler\\'s life offers a penetrating look into the damaging and tyrannical leadership of one of the most infamous dictators in history. But it\\'s not just Hitler under a microscope; in this book, the people around him who formed the baseline that allowed Hitler to claim power within Europe are examined, too, including the broader socio-political environment and the German public\\'s complicity.\\nWho should read: Readers who want to learn more about the unprecedented run of Europe\\'s most notorious dictator and the historical implications of his legacy.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Penguin Random House.\\nAndrew Roberts\\' Churchill: Walking with Destiny is a thoughtful biography of one of Britain\\'s most acclaimed political leaders and his impact on the Second World War.

By relying on a range of primary sources, Beevor, through prudent attention to detail, gives an authoritative interpretation of the execution and aftermath of the Normandy invasion and is praised for covering the event from its planning stages to the liberation of Paris. Beevor proves to be an effective storyteller by giving voice to soldiers from various nations and addressing the civilian toll, particularly on the French population. His attention to sensory detail—describing sights, sounds, and emotions—does more than narrate the true events of the brutal war; it immerses readers into the when and where of the war.\\nWho should read: War history buffs who enjoy books with detailed research and analysis will appreciate this book.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Penguin Random House.\\nUnited States Army Air Forces Eighth Air Force walk away from their aircraft after their bombing ...

The story is told from the perspective of the Henry family. It follows Victor \\'Pug\\' Henry, his wife, Rhoda, and their three grown children six months before Germany invades Poland in September 1939, and ends shortly after the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941. Wouk\\'s scaled combination of fiction and true-life events includes cameos from World War II leaders like Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin. While the novel touches on the military, diplomatic, and personal challenges of the time, it also connects to lesser-known details of intelligence work and operations influencing wartime strategies. The Henry family becomes the central part of the novel, helping Wouk to weave this story together using drama, romance and heroism. These combinations of well-known historical events and obscure details make Wouk\\'s perspective on World War II memorable.\\nWho should read: Enthusiasts who approve of historical narrations of events with a dose of fiction.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Hachette Book Group.\\nGuy Sajer\\'s The Forgotten Soldier is a powerful memoir that engages readers in the vanguard of the Eastern Front during World War II. Sajer, a French-German soldier, presents war as a struggle for survival, and he does so by describing the hunger, fatigue and constant deprivation that formed the core of his relationship with war. Some historians argue that the book leans towards a Roman à-clef—a novelized memoir—rather than a strictly factual account. However, many veterans and readers still consider it a valuable representation of the German soldier\\'s experience on the Eastern Front. Sajer noted the imperfections in his account but shared that he wrote The Forgotten Soldier based on his experience during a very stressful time and his recollection may not have been perfect.\\nWho should read: Readers interested in memoirs that narrate significant moments in history.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Barnes & Noble.\\nThe author of A Woman in Berlin was a mystery for over forty years. It wasn\\'t until 2003, after she died, that readers found out that Marta Hillers, a German journalist, wrote this gutting memoir. The book itself, a compilation of Hiller\\'s diary during the war, begins on Friday, 20 April 1945, Hitler\\'s 56th birthday, during a period when the Russian army was at the edge of Berlin. In this book, Hillers gives an honest perspective of the violence that she and many women faced in the aftermath of the war and their attempts at self-preservation despite the dangers they faced. Hillers\\' account of assaulted women, including herself, forming relationships with Soviet officers for protection shows just how the devastating toll of the war, especially on women, and her commentary is not just unvarnished; it is a brave account of the war\\'s civilian cost.\\nWho should read: Readers who are not afraid to read about memoirs about rare and unfiltered account\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Macmillan Publishers.\\nRick Atkinson\\'s Pulitzer-winning book An Army at Dawn: The War in North Africa, 1942–1943, is a well-researched literary review of the North African campaign during WWII. It is the first book in Atkinson\\'s Liberation Trilogy. The book takes readers on a journey back in time and analyzes the American army\\'s initial challenges and eventual triumphs as they powered through the challenges of Operation Torch and the difficult battles in Tunisia. Atkinson relies on first-hand resources like letters, personal diaries of soldiers and military documents to give every reader the most inverted account of the war possible. Atkinson points more than to the steep learning curve that the inexperienced American army faced; he also points to evolving cooperation among Allied forces. The account also focuses on the story\\'s human importance—the commanders and soldiers, their on-the-ground experiences and the challenges faced by key figures like Dwight D. Eisenhower and general George S. Patton Jr.\\nWho should read: Readers who are interested in understanding the strategic, tactical and operational aspects of the war.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Barnes & Noble.\\nAntony Beevor\\'s Stalingrad brings the brutal siege to life through interviews with survivors and military documents from both German and Soviet archives. Although the book touches on Operation Barbarossa, Germany\\'s invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, it zones in on the Battle of Stalingrad and the brutal combat, strategic moves and war crimes committed on both sides of the battle. Beevor also offers a backward look in time to August 1942, when Hitler\\'s Sixth Army reached the city, setting the stage for one of the war\\'s most dramatic turning points—the Soviet counteroffensive and eventual victory. Each chapter has a multi-layered depiction of the human suffering, starvation and brutality that defined the critical battle.\\nWho should read: This book is a valuable text for history students, specifically those interested in World War II, Soviet history or military strategy.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Penguin Random House.\\nAll the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr is a book that combines the stories of two young characters—Marie-Laure LeBlanc, a blind French girl, and Werner Pfennig, a German boy whose radio engineering talents gets him enlisted into the Nazi regime, where he uses his skills to locate and intercept illegal broadcasts from the French Resistance. This talent eventually led Werner to cross paths with Marie-Laure when his mission to track illegal radio broadcasts during the German occupation of France brought him to the coastal town of Saint-Malo. History fans have praised Doerr for his lyrical storytelling and nonlinear plot, which follows both protagonists in alternating chapters. Doerr\\'s depiction of the connection between the two protagonists, regardless of their different backgrounds, is a memorable contribution to fictional interpretations of the Second World War. This book is a brilliant addition to the literature of World War II and is one of the best fictional interpretations of the Second World War on this list.

Cornelius Ryan\\'s A Bridge Too Far is a seminal work on Operation Market Garden, one of the most ambitious yet ultimately failed military operations of World War II. Ryan\\'s relies on interviews with soldiers and civilians alike makes this a must-read for anyone looking to understand the complicated war operations. The operation, devised by British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, aimed to seize key bridges in Nazi-occupied Netherlands to create a path for an Allied invasion of Germany by Christmas 1944, and like several entries on this list, Ryan\\'s analysis probes into the strategic analysis with personal stories from soldiers and civilians. The operation, which combined airborne and ground forces, was supposed to capture five strategic bridges and it required precise coordination between British, American and Polish forces, but suffered from poor intelligence, logistical issues and unexpected German resistance. The failure to secure the final bridge at Arnhem—a \\'bridge too far\\'—caused the collapse of the mission.\\nWho should read: Readers interested in World War II history, particularly lesser-known but pivotal campaigns, A Bridge Too Far is a must-read.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Simon & Schuster.\\nStephen E.

The war, which would eventually push Louis to enlist in the United States Army Air Corps, where his story of grit and survival would form. After his plane getting shot down during the war, Louis would spend 47 days on a raft in the Pacific Ocean, and then be tortured mercilessly in Japanese POW camps. In this non-fictional body of work, Hillenbrand goes beyond merely recounting Louis\\' physical endurance; she incisively looks into his life after release—his struggles with faith, relationships, God and his path back to healing and inspiration.

In The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, Shirer suggests that some aspects of German national character, culture and history contributed to Hitler\\'s rise, but he does not solely attribute Hitler\\'s rise to these factors. His reporting in this book takes a chronological look at the rise and fall of Nazi Germany, beginning with Adolf Hitler\\'s birth and ending in World War II in Europe in 1945. His analysis dissects the political, social, and economic currents that pushed a nation into totalitarianism, along with the events and personalities that influenced that period.\\nWho should read: The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand the origins of a dictatorial regime that brought the world to the brink of destruction.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Simon & Schuster.\\nKristin Hannah\\'s The Nightingale is a tribute to the unsung heroines of World War II and a close follow-up to the inspiring story of two sisters in Nazi-occupied France.

Vianne, the more reclusive of the two sister decided to protect Jewish children by hiding them, while Isabelle, the more rebellious and stubborn sister, joined the French Resistance, a group of people who fought the Nazis and the Vichy regime in France during the Second World War.

(Photo by)\\nThanks to Joseph Heller, the term \\'Catch-22\\' has become a part of the global pop culture lexicon, which means any situation where contradictory rules or conditions trap a person. In this satire, Heller tells the story of Captain Yossarian, a frustrated bombardier stationed on a Mediterranean island during World War II, who becomes increasingly desperate to survive after he suspects the military is trying to kill him. The novel is not just brilliant because of its absurdity; its dark humor and philosophical themes within the story create a plot that is both hilarious and unsettling. Heller\\'s description of the bureaucratic nature of military life is spot-on, while his sharp critique of war and authority resonates with many people. Because of this, this book has become a cornerstone of modern literature and one that continues to challenge, entertain and encourage conversation.\\nWho should read: People who enjoy fictional works that tackle serious topics through biting satire.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Simon & Schuster.\\nKurt Vonnegut\\'s Slaughterhouse-Five is more than just an anti-war American classic novel; it follows the fractured lens of Billy Pilgrim, a barber\\'s son, turned drafted soldier who becomes \\'unstuck in time,\" especially after surviving the apocalyptic firebombing of Dresden. In this novel, Vonnegut defies linear storytelling, much like the chaotic nature of war itself, to follow Billy\\'s disorienting journey through time and space as a reflection of the randomness and unpredictability that life—and war—imposes. Vonnegut repeatedly juxtaposes the real-life horrors of war with moments of dark humor to create an unconventional depiction of the war, which is inspired by Vonnegut\\'s own experiences as a prisoner of war in Dresden during World War II.\\nWho should read: Readers who have a taste for dark, satirical humor will find that Slaughterhouse-Five consistently delivers.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Penguin Random House.\\nMany World War II books, fictional or not, have become important heirlooms of moments in time offering different generations of readers insight into one of the most devastating conflicts in human history.

       "   'summary': \"Equity markets were up smartly for the week ended September 13 with three of the four major averages up between 4% and 6% (see table). Only the Dow Jones lagged (+2.60%), mainly for wont of a high concentration of tech names. Normally, that 2.60% rise would make investors ecstatic.\\nEquity Markets\\nAs usual, tech led the way. Nvidia (NVDA), closing at $119.08, advanced nearly 16% for the week, and has made up nearly all of September's falloff. It is now within striking distance of its August 23rd peak closing price ($129.37). The rest of the Magnificent 7 advanced between 4% and 10%, except for Apple (AAPL) which is still suffering from disappointing investors at its recently held quarterly meeting.\\nMagnificent 7\\nOn the fixed income side, yields continued to soften with the 10-Year Treasury yield now at 3.66%\\n10 Year Treasury Yield\\nThe latest Consumer Price Index came out on Wednesday (September 11th) for August, and it showed that inflation continued on its downward path. The overall index rose just +0.2% for the month and 2.5% from a year ago, the lowest that annual number has been since all the way back to February of 2021 – that's 3.5 years ago!\\nThe 'core' rate of inflation which excludes food and energy, and the index followed closely by Federal Reserve policymakers – that rose 0.3% in August and 3.2% on a year-over-year basis. And that 3.2% number was tied for the lowest level since April of 2021.\\nU.S. consumer price index\\nTo show the progress on inflation, looking only at the last three months and annualizing those numbers puts the headline number at +1.1%, and the core at 2.1%. In our weekly blogs, we have discussed the computational issue that is part and parcel of the construction of the consumer price index. The issue there is that the shelter component (mostly rents) which has a large 36% weighting in the index, is lagged. That means the data is not current, and, in fact, the rent data used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to construct the index, is 9-12 months old. An up-to-date rent index, like the Apartment List Index, shows that, on a national basis, rents have actually fallen -0.7% over the year ending in August.\\nSo, if we exclude those old rents from the Consumer Price Index, that index behaved quite well: 0.0% in August, 0.0% in July, and -0.2% in both June and May. And remember, current rents are falling, so if they were included, we would actually be seeing deflation.\\nFor some reason or other, and despite the fact that the last 3-month trend is what is most likely to continue in the near future, markets like to look at year-over-year comparisons. So, looked at from this perspective (year-over-year), if we exclude rents, the Consumer Price Index was flat (0.0%) for the two months July and August and rose just +1.1% from a year earlier. In July, that number was +1.7%. So, you can see just how rapidly inflation is subsiding. Virtually all the rise in the CPI ln August was due to the rise in insurance premiums and to shelter costs. The insurance premiums are a one-time catch-up phenomenon, and the rise in the shelter component is from the lagged data used by BLS as discussed earlier. (Shelter costs, as noted, are actually falling.) The prices of goods, on net, are flat to down.\\nYoY Change in National Rent Index (2019 - Present)\\nMeanwhile, the Fed is about to make its first mini-move to lower historically restrictive interest rates. Because I think the Fed is 'late to the party' or 'behind the curve' in easing monetary policy (let's not forget that there is a long lag between when the Fed implements monetary policy changes and the impact of those changes on the economy), I expect that the disinflation we have seen so far (i.e., slower price increases) will actually become deflation (i.e. actual lower prices) by year's end. We've already begun to see this in prices at the gas pump.\\nTo reiterate: the inflation genie has been put back into the bottle as inflation is now effectively at the Fed's 2% goal. Meanwhile, the Fed is about to take its first baby step, a 25 or perhaps 50 basis point rate reduction, toward easing its historically restrictive monetary policy. In our view, the Fed is 'behind the curve,' and that is why we believe that a bout of deflation, i.e., falling prices, lies ahead.\\nAverage Gasoline Pries Fell -4.5% During August; Online Grocery Prices Fall by the Most in August\\nThe two charts above show just how deflationary August really was. The price of gas declined about -8% during the month, while the prices of online groceries were down nearly -4%.\\nMeanwhile, consumers have begun to tighten their purse strings. In the Q2 earnings reports of major retailers, CEO commentary was unanimous in reporting that consumers had begun to pull back. While they continued to spend on essentials/necessities, they reduced outlays on discretionary items, now looking for bargains.\\nThe Fed's Beige Book assesses current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. It characterizes regional economic conditions based on information gathered directly from businesses. Here is a sample of comments from the August Book, published on Wednesday, September 4th.\\nSample of comments from the August Book\\nContinuing with the plight of the consumer, in the housing industry, mortgage purchase applications have fallen to 30-year lows despite the fall in mortgage rates from 7.9% last October to 6.3% in August (a 160-basis point decline). Given Fed Chair Powell's announcement at the Fed's Jackson Hole symposium that the Fed would begin to lower rates in September, perhaps potential homebuyers, or those trading up or down, are waiting for mortgage rates to fall even further.\\nMortgage Purchase Applications\\nIn past blogs we've discussed the rising trend in credit card and auto loan delinquencies. Along this line of thought, the NY Fed does a survey of consumer attitudes and expectations. Two concerning trends have emerged as shown in the following chart: 1) the rise in consumer expectations that they will become delinquent on a debt payment in the next three months; and 2) the upward trend in the probability of losing a job.\\nDebt Delinquency Expected Over Next 3 Months; Probability of Losing a Job\\nGoing back to last week's jobs report, the sister to the Establishment Survey Payroll Report, the Household Survey reported that -438K full-time jobs were lost in August, but they were replaced by +527K part-time jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics counts full-time and part-time jobs as the same (i.e., each equal to one job). In our view, a more realistic approach is to count a part-time job as equal to one-half of a full-time position. Using this approach, the +527K part-time jobs become the equivalent of +263K full-time. So, the loss of -438K full-time jobs was only partially offset by the +263K jobs attributable as full-time. That's a net loss of -175K full-time jobs. So, it isn't a wonder to us why the Fed's Beige Book carried so many negatives on consumer spending, why auto and credit card delinquencies are on the rise, and why consumer worries about losing a job and missing a debt payment are on upward trends. On a side note, PwC announced layoffs of 1,800 employees, the first job cuts for that company since '09. (Wait a minute! Wasn't '09 part of the Great Recession?)\\nThe rest of the world, too, is slowing down. This past week, the European Central Bank (ECB) lowered its reference rate by -25 basis points to 3.50% (note that the Fed, at 5.25%, is way behind the curve) in response to economic softness in Euroland, especially in Germany, where Industrial Production fell a whopping -2.4% in July, and their Manufacturing PMI fell to 42.4 (below 50 means contraction). We also note that Volkswagen (VW) announced layoffs, breaking a three-decade security pact with its German employees.\\nAnd then there is China which remains deeply in Recession. Property values have melted. Consumers had been using home equity appreciation to finance consumption, but that source has now dried up. As a result, the government has moved interest rates lower in an effort to spur economic growth. But there, like here, there is a long lag between a policy action and its impact on the economy.\\nThe CPI and PPI reports were in line with market expectations and were the last inflation reports before the Fed's imminent meeting (September 17-18). At the August Jackson Hole conclave, Chairman Powell indicated that the Fed would be loosening policy restraints, code for lowering the Fed Funds Rate. Since then, the financial community has debated how large the first rate cut will be, i.e., -25 or -50 basis points. Our view is that the rate cut will be -25 basis points. The reason: a -50 basis point cut would spook financial markets, giving them concern that the Fed sees something more sinister than a 'soft-landing.'\\nFinancial markets continue to march higher, mostly in anticipation of the beginning of a Fed easing cycle and the prospect of an economic 'soft-landing.' A -25 basis point reduction in the Fed Funds Rate is what is currently expected, and markets will likely continue to rise unless the language of the Fed statement and/or Chairman Powell's post-meeting press conference paint a different picture (unlikely). A -50 basis point reduction would send a message to the financial markets that the Fed sees the economy slowing too fast, and that would cause a drawdown in those markets.\\nThe inflation data was benign with some emerging deflationary characteristics, like rapidly falling gasoline and grocery prices. And the Fed's own Beige Book was nothing more than a compendium of emerging softness in consumption. Such softness can be seen in the fall of mortgage purchase applications to 30-year lows despite falling mortgage rates. In addition, there is growing consumer concern over job security and their ability to service their existing debts.\\nFurther, despite the hyped jobs headline (+142K), deeper analysis shows that full-time jobs are evaporating, being replaced by part-time ones. While the BLS counts full-time and part-time jobs as equal, a more reasonable approach, counting part-time as half a full-time job, leads to the conclusion that the job market has weakened considerably.\\nEconomic growth in the rest of the world has slowed. Germany looks Recessionary. The European Central Bank just lowered their reference rate by -25 basis points to 3.50%. China's economy remains in a downturn.\\nAt its imminent September meeting, the Fed is expected to lower rates by -25 basis points. If they lowered by -50-basis points, that would send a message to financial markets that the Fed sees the economy slowing too fast. Because the Fed knows this would play havoc with the equity market, it is quite unlikely to occur.\\n(Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.)\",\n",

U.S.-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles would enhance that capability, but they are too costly and limited in number to reshape the dynamic, they said.\\nMoreover, the Kremlin has largely moved perhaps the most immediate threat -- Russian warplanes launching glide bombs -- beyond the range of the U.S. missiles, the U.S. officials said.\\nThey also believe Kyiv should focus on halting a Russian advance in Ukraine\\'s east.\\nFor Biden, the decision is not just tactical. It raises questions about whether authorizing such strikes might risk a direct war between NATO and Russia.\\nRussia warned at the United Nations on Friday that authorizing Ukraine to fire missiles far into Russia would turn NATO into \"a direct party to hostilities against a nuclear power,\" and Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that such a move would alter the scope of the conflict.\\nWhite House spokesman John Kirby said on Friday the United States took such threats seriously, even as he acknowledged there was nothing new in Putin\\'s rhetoric.\\nDemocratic U.S. Representative Jason Crow, a member of the House intelligence and foreign affairs committees, downplayed the threat of Putin attacking Poland or other NATO members in retaliation.\\n\"I don\\'t believe there\\'s any indication that Vladimir Putin has an interest in picking a fight with NATO,\" he told Reuters, pointing to Russia\\'s massive losses of men and armor in Ukraine. \"To the contrary, I think he is avoiding a NATO confrontation.\"\\nSpeaking at Ramstein Air Base in Germany a week ago, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the United States and its allies to ignore Russia\\'s red lines and give permission for long-range strikes into Russia as a way to pressure Moscow.\\n\"We need to have this long-range capability not only on the occupied territory of Ukraine, but also on Russian territory ... so that Russia is motivated to seek peace,\" Zelenskiy said.\\nTwo European diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Ukraine has submitted to the U.S. and Britain a list of potential targets inside Russia that could be hit if allowed.\\nThe discussion about whether to ease restrictions on Ukraine echoes prior debates about Kyiv\\'s pleas for other capabilities it hoped would give it an edge against Russian forces, from F-16 fighter jets to Abrams tanks.\\n\"You\\'ve heard this (debate) before,\" said one U.S. official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity.\\nUkrainians initially wanted to use U.S.-supplied ATACMS long-range missiles to hit Russian airbases, officials said.\\nBut the Pentagon has said 90% of Russian aircraft launching glide bombs, one of the top threats for Ukraine, are at airfields at least 300 kilometers (186 miles) away from Ukrainian-controlled territory.

It raises questions about whether authorizing such strikes might risk a direct war between NATO and Russia.\\nRussia warned at the United Nations on Friday that authorizing Ukraine to fire missiles far into Russia would turn NATO into \"a direct party to hostilities against a nuclear power,\" and Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that such a move would alter the scope of the conflict.\\nWhite House spokesman John Kirby said on Friday the United States took such threats seriously, even as he acknowledged there was nothing new in Putin\\'s rhetoric.\\nDemocratic U.S. Representative Jason Crow, a member of the House intelligence and foreign affairs committees, downplayed the threat of Putin attacking Poland or other NATO members in retaliation.\\n\"I don\\'t believe there\\'s any indication that Vladimir Putin has an interest in picking a fight with NATO,\" he told Reuters, pointing to Russia\\'s massive losses of men and armor in Ukraine. \"To the contrary, I think he is avoiding a NATO confrontation.\"\\nWHAT WOULD UKRAINE STRIKE IN RUSSIA?\\nSpeaking at Ramstein Air Base in Germany a week ago, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the United States and its allies to ignore Russia\\'s red lines and give permission for long-range strikes into Russia as a way to pressure Moscow.\\n\"We need to have this long-range capability not only on the occupied territory of Ukraine, but also on Russian territory ... so that Russia is motivated to seek peace,\" Zelenskiy said.\\nTwo European diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Ukraine has submitted to the U.S. and Britain a list of potential targets inside Russia that could be hit if allowed.\\nThe discussion about whether to ease restrictions on Ukraine echoes prior debates about Kyiv\\'s pleas for other capabilities it hoped would give it an edge against Russian forces, from F-16 fighter jets to Abrams tanks.\\n\"You\\'ve heard this (debate) before,\" said one U.S. official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity.\\nUkrainians initially wanted to use U.S.-supplied ATACMS long-range missiles to hit Russian airbases, officials said.\\nBut the Pentagon has said 90% of Russian aircraft launching glide bombs, one of the top threats for Ukraine, are at airfields at least 300 kilometers (186 miles) away from Ukrainian-controlled territory. That puts them out of range of the ATACMS.\\nUkraine now wants to use the missiles to strike Russian military command and control hubs, fuel and weapons depots and troop concentrations, officials said.\\nIn addition to U.S. ATACMS, Kyiv wants to carry out long-range strikes into Russia using Storm Shadow missiles provided by Britain and the nearly identical French SCALP missiles.\\nAlthough Britain is expected to seek U.S. approval before lifting its restrictions on Storm Shadow missiles, a French diplomatic source said Paris did not need authorization from Washington for Ukraine to use French missiles.\\nFOCUS ON GROUND WAR\\nAnother U.S. concern is that focusing on long-range strikes downplays what could be a bigger immediate threat: Russia\\'s advances on the ground inside Ukrainian territory toward the strategic city of Pokrovsk. U.S. officials believe the loss of the city would deal a significant blow.\\nAnalysts said Russia has many response options, short of direct war with NATO, if the United States or its allies allow Ukraine to unleash strikes deep into Russia.\\nIn June, Putin spoke of possibly arming the West\\'s enemies with Russian weapons to strike Western targets abroad, and of deploying conventional missiles within striking distance of the United States and its European allies.\\nUlrich Kuehn, an arms expert at the Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy in Hamburg, said he did not rule out Putin choosing to send some kind of nuclear message - for example testing a nuclear weapon in an effort to cow the West.\\nStill, Crow, the U.S. lawmaker, argued that Putin was in a weaker position after the Ukraine invasion, and any major response from Moscow created risks for him.\\n\"Vladimir Putin is not 10-feet tall. We have seen that repeatedly over the last couple of years. He\\'s very vulnerable, and frankly, he\\'s in a position of significant weakness,\\' said Crow.\\n(Additional reporting by John Irish in Paris, Elizabeth Piper, Mark Trevelyan and Andrew Osborn in London; Editing by Don Durfee and Cynthia Osterman)',\n",

       "   'summary': 'When school started this year for Mikalay in Belarus, the 15-year-old discovered that his teachers and administrators no longer called him by that name. Instead, they referred to him as Nikolai, its Russian equivalent.\\nWhat\\'s more, classes at his school — one of the country\\'s best — are now taught in Russian, not Belarusian, which he has spoken for most of his life.\\nBelarusians like Mikalay are experiencing a new wave of Russification as Moscow expands its economic, political and cultural dominance to overtake the identity of its neighbour.\\nThis isn\\'t unprecedented. During the czarist and Soviet eras, Russia imposed its language, symbols, and cultural institutions on Belarus. However, after the USSR dissolved in 1991, Belarus began to reclaim its identity. Belarusian briefly became the official language, and the white-red-white national flag replaced the Soviet-era red hammer and sickle.\\nThe situation shifted in 1994 when Alexander Lukashenko, a former Soviet collective farm official, came to power. He made Russian an official language alongside Belarusian and removed the nationalist symbols.\\nNow, with Lukashenko in power for over three decades, he has permitted Russia to dominate various aspects of life in Belarus, a nation of 9.5 million. Belarusian is rarely heard on the streets of Minsk and other large cities. Official business is conducted in Russian, which also dominates the media. Lukashenko speaks only Russian, and government officials often avoid using Belarusian.\\nThe country relies on Russian loans and cheap energy, forming a political and military alliance with Moscow. This alliance allows President Vladimir Putin to station troops and missiles in Belarus, using it as a staging area for the war in Ukraine.\\n\\'I understand that our Belarus is occupied. … And who is the president there? Not Lukashenko. The president is Putin,\\' said Svetlana Alexievich, the 2015 Nobel Prize in Literature winner, who lives in Germany in effective exile. \\'The nation has been humiliated and it will be very difficult for Belarusians to recover from this.\\'\\nBelarusian cultural figures have faced persecution, and hundreds of nationalist organisations have been shut down. Experts suggest that Moscow aims to implement in Belarus what it intended for Ukraine when the war there began in 2022.\\n\\'It is obvious that our children are being deliberately deprived of their native language, history, and Belarusian identity, but parents have been strongly advised not to ask questions about Russification,\\' said Anatoly, father of a Belarusian student, speaking on condition of anonymity due to fear of retribution.\\n\\'We were informed about the synchronisation of the curriculum with Russia this year and were shown a propaganda film about how the Ukrainian special services are allegedly recruiting our teenagers and forcing them to commit sabotage in Belarus,\\' he added.\\nOnly a few schools have managed to retain some paperwork and courses in Belarusian. In recent years, one of these schools saw dozens of its teachers fired, and the Belarusian-language section of its website disappeared.\\nLukashenko derides his native language, stating, \\'Nothing great can be expressed in Belarusian. … There are only two great languages in the world: Russian and English.\\'\\nBelarus was part of the Russian empire for centuries and became one of the 15 Soviet republics after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. Daily use of Belarusian decreased and continued only in the country\\'s west, north, and rural areas.\\nIn 1994, about 40% of students were taught in Belarusian; now, it\\'s under 9%. Speaking Belarusian is seen as opposition to Lukashenko and a declaration of national identity, which played a key role in the mass protests after the disputed 2020 election that gave Lukashenko a sixth term. In the harsh crackdown that followed, half a million people fled the country.\\nAt the same time, \\'more people want to speak Belarusian, which has become one of the symbols of freedom, but they\\'re afraid to do it in public,\\' said Alina Nahornaja, author of \\'Language 404,\\' a book about Belarusians who faced discrimination for speaking their native language.\\nLike Ukrainians, Belarusians desired closer ties with Europe, accompanying their nationalist sentiment, noted Belarusian analyst Valery Karbalevich. \\'But the Kremlin quickly realised the danger and began the process of creeping Russification in Belarus,\\' he added.\\nThis led to the emergence of pro-Russian organisations, joint educational programmes, and cultural projects, \\'like mushrooms after the rain — against the backdrop of harsh repressions against everything Belarusian,\\' Karbalevich said.\\nCensorship and bans affect not only contemporary Belarusian literature but also its classics. In 2023, the prosecutor\\'s office declared extremist the 19th-century poems of Vincent Dunin-Martsinkyevich, who opposed the Russian Empire.\\nWhen the Kremlin supported Lukashenko against the anti-government protests in 2020, it ensured his loyalty and received carte blanche in Belarus.\\n\\'Today, Lukashenko is paying Putin with our sovereignty,\\' said exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. \\'Belarusian national identity, cultures, and language are our strongest weapons against the Russian world and Russification.\\'\\nIn February she had posted on X that \"being labeled as \\'extremist\\' means loving your country & speaking your language.\"\\nFour cities in Belarus now host a \\'Russia House\\' to promote Russian culture and influence, offering seminars, film clubs, exhibitions, and competitions.\\n\\'The goal is to plant Russian narratives so that as many Belarusians as possible view Russian as their own,\\' said analyst Alexander Friedman. \\'The Kremlin spares no expense and acts on a grand scale, which could be especially effective and dangerous in a situation where Belarus has found itself in information isolation, and there is almost no one left inside the country to resist the Russian world.\\'\\n\\'Putin published an article denying the existence of an independent Ukraine back in 2021, and even then we understood perfectly well that he was pursuing similar goals in Belarus,\" Latushka said.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is being linked once again with an explosive cross-city transfer to Manchester City amid claims the player has been struggling with 'bullying' from club legends and former players.\\nThe Red Devils squeaked a win in their Premier League opener against Fulham but have since lost successive matches to Brighton and Liverpool, ramping up the early pressure on Erik ten Hag. And while Manchester United will expect a major improvement on last season's eighth-placed finish – their all-time worst finish in the Premier League era – they go into this weekend's round of matches sat in a lowly 14th place.\\nOne player Ten Hag will be hoping to get the best of is Rashford, who scored a hugely-impressive 30 goals in Ten Hag's first season at the club, but then saw his form badly dip in the 2023/24 campaign, ultimately costing him his place in England's European Championships squad.\\nSo far this season, Rashford has yet to contribute a goal or an assist from three appearances – and Ten Hag will be concerned he is yet to show his best.\\nAnd with El Nacional reporting that Rashford is open to performing the 'ultimate betrayal' by signing for Manchester City next year, claims of his unhappiness with life at Manchester United have taken a shock new downturn amid a claim by the i paper that the 26-year-old feels he is being 'bullied' by a bunch of the club's former players.\\nCiting a source from within United's academy, the i claims that those close to Rashford now see the 'onslaught' as 'bullying' from some ex-players and legends.\\n'When someone else misplaces a pass it does not get mentioned, but when it is Marcus it's different,' one source told i.\\nREAD MORE Alan Shearer returns fire in war of words with Erik ten Hag over Marcus Rashford\\nThe report continued: 'Very different. The criticism coming his way is an onslaught. It is bullying. Supporters believe what senior ex-players say, which only makes worse.\\n'The club have spent £100m on central strikers and Marcus is back out wide, as a facilitator. And he is doing his job in that regard. It isn't his fault the chances aren't being put away.'\\nThe i claims Rashford has undergone a period of intense personal training during the international break in a sign that the player still believes he can succeed at the highest level and regain his place in the England squad and despite some of the club's former stars having their own doubts.\\nAmong those condemning his displays has been Gary Neville, who admitted after the Liverpool game that he has been 'sad' watching Rashford's performances over the previous 14 months.\\n'He had a one-on-one with Konate. And you might not be having a great day. You might not be having a great time.\\n'But you've still got to go for it and take the one-on-one on. And he just turned back. That just tells you where his head at.\\n'I'd like to think [he can get back to his best]. It's been going on for 14 months. He scored 30 goals the season before last. I'd like to think he can get his confidence back.\\n'It's looking like a struggle for him. The game doesn't look enjoyable right now. And that's sad. As it is for seeing Casemiro in the first half, it's sad watching that kid because he has been a joy for Manchester United at times in his career.\\n'But it's getting hard work for him. And it's getting hard for Manchester United fans to watch him.'\\nMeanwhile, another star who failed to show his best while at United, Donny van de Beek, has come clean on his struggles while at Old Trafford.\\nThe Dutchman was an initial £35m signing by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in the delayed summer 2020 transfer window, but rarely showed anywhere near the form expected of him and he departed in a lowly up front fee of just €500,000 (£420,000 / $555,000) to Girona this summer.\\n'I think it's clear that it didn't work out for both sides,' Van de Beek said in an extended interview.\\n'But that's the past and I have nothing bad to say about the club.'\\nElsewhere today, Bayern Munich star Jamal Musiala has insisted he was only 'joking' when suggesting he had discussed a future move to Old Trafford with his former teammate and current Red Devils star Joshua Zirkzee.\\nAnd while the two men played together at Bayern, the prospects of the 21-year-old Germany playmaker being lured away look bleak in the face of a big declaration on his new deal by the Bundesliga giants.\\nAt his very best there is no doubting that Rashford is one of the very best around and his qualities are there for all to see.\\nHowever, as his statistics show, his form has been extremely up and down over the years and the player that was evident in the 2022/23 campaign appears to have been lost within him.\\nHe has had peaks and troughs before, bouncing back superbly in that first season under Ten Hag from where he had been the year previously.\\nMarcus Rashford Man Utd stats\\nOverall, the player boasts 136 goals and 69 assists from 420 appearances at the time of writing, giving him a goal contribution every 2.048 times he has appeared for the club.\\nAnd while that record is not to be sniffed at and underlines his very obvious qualities, it would be terrifying to think what those numbers would look like if he were to have produced his very best year-in, year-out.\\nDON'T MISS Arne Slot 'connection' cited as Liverpool rival Man City for €80m star who 'vetoed' Man Utd move\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'Wine sommelier Alisha Blackwell-Calvert shares expert tips seasonal wine pairings, menu ideas and creating a cozy atmosphere.',\n",
       "   'summary': 'To ensure your gathering is both elegant and enjoyable, expert advice can make all the difference.\\nCooler months are approaching, but that doesn\\'t mean social gatherings are slowing down. If anything, the holiday season will be here before you know it, and the social calendar will be full.\\nPlanning a memorable event can be excessively stressful at times, but with a little guidance and research, you can put together a menu worth of a top chef or sommelier.\\n\"Providing variety in wine styles is the best way to accommodate varying preferences at dinner parties,\\' says Alisha Blackwell-Calvert, an award-winning advanced sommelier and beverage director of the new Italian-American restaurant Madrina in St. Louis. \\'Focus on providing popular varieties to ensure there is something for everyone.\\'\\nSpecifically, Blackwell-Calvert suggests pinot grigio and oaked chardonnay for whites then pinot noir and cabernet sauvignon for reds. \\'These varieties are on opposite ends of their respective spectrums,\\' she explains. \\'Having a sweeter option like moscato, brachetto or a kabinett-level riesling will guarantee a glass for every palate.\"\\nMaribel Lieberman, owner of New York chocolate boutique MarieBelle and author of coffee table book MarieBelle Entertains, says dining should be an elevated and enjoyable experience.\\n\\'Pairing each course with a wine makes the meal even more memorable,\\' Lieberman tells Forbes. \\'I enjoy creating dishes and combining ingredients based on taste, texture and color. I believe that the right wine pairing makes or breaks the experience of the meal. While I pair each course with a wine that I think will bring out the flavor and experience of the dish, I think it\\'s important to have versatile and alternative offerings for those who may prefer something else.\\'\\nWith that in mind, here are some some expert tips on how to create a wine-focused dinner party menu at home like a pro for three different types of festive gatherings.\\nWines that are enjoyed outside should be refreshing, notes Blackwell-Calvert. And serving temperature is important in wine service, so be cautious while enjoying wine outside in hot temperatures.\\n\"When pairing wines for lighter, seasonal dishes for an outdoor gathering, I would recommend crisp whites like sauvignon blanc and riesling or reds from low-tannin varieties that can withstand a chill like those produced from gamay or pinot noir,\\' Blackwell-Calvert says. \\'Highly tannic, full-bodied wines like a powerful cabernet sauvignon may seem too bitter and boozy to compliment summer\\'s more delicate food offerings if served at hot outdoor temperatures.\"\\nFor Courtney Storer, culinary producer of the Emmy-winning series, The Bear, her approach to cooking focuses on using seasonal and locally sourced ingredients. Admittedly, she says, this works really well year-round in Los Angeles (as seen through a dinner party she recently worked on for Miraval Rosé, but stresses you can easily follow this advice from anywhere in the U.S. to prepare simple yet flavorful dishes that highlight the natural tastes and textures in the ingredients.\\n\\'Less is more. It\\'s a common French approach in cooking and in life,\\' Storer tells Forbes. Instead of a formal dinner, make a grazing style table with your favorite dishes. Create a laid-back tablescape that is elegant by not overthinking it. I like to use a few extra items I\\'m featuring on my menu as part of the table décor. Some extra fruit, vegetables and bread that are part of your meal will look great as décor in baskets or platters.\\'\\nWinter pairings can sometimes be tricky due to the season\\'s heavier comfort foods.\\n\\'To not overwhelm the palate with pairings, a well-made red or white that has a balance of acidity is crucial,\\' Blackwell-Calvert says. \\'Acid will prevent both the wine and the food from overloading your tastebuds. The chosen grape variety isn\\'t as important as the quality of the wine itself.\\'\\nIn general, winter is the perfect season to enjoy bold reds, she notes.\\n\\'The jammy fruit and spice characters of these styles are great flavor accompaniments to hearty food,\\' Blackwell-Calvert says. \\'Look for wines made from montepulciano, primitivo, carmenere or petite sirah as outside the box choices that pair wonderfully with traditional holiday flavors.\"\\nFor creating a memorable wine dinner party experience, presentation plays a vital role. Take into account the type of glassware, plateware and silverware.\\nFor a plated dinner, Blackwell-Calvert says, ensure that the next course\\'s wine is in the glass just before the food arrives. It will give the guests time to prime their palates for the next pairing. For a buffet-style event, make sure wine is easily accessible and easy to serve.\\n\\'My front-of-house experience made me a firm believer that wine is a major part of curating culinary experiences,\\' Storer notes. \\'I\\'ve always been more drawn to wines that help break the ice, bottles that tell a story and make people feel comfortable while still offering a sense of finesse.\\'\\nPro tip: \\'For wine on ice in a self-service environment, leave a serviette or linen cloth at the ice station for guests to wipe bottles while handling and to help keep their hands dry,\\' Blackwell-Calvert says. \\'Details matter and supplying everything a guest may possibly need will add a \\'wow\\' factor to the experience.\"\\nThere is a common misconception that bubbles are only for special occasions or holidays, like anniversaries or New Year\\'s Eve. But really, sparkling wine can be enjoyed year-round, regardless of date or the temperature outside. (That said, of course the temperature of the bottle should always be chilled.)\\n\\'A great wine doesn\\'t have to be a stuffy or overly expensive,\\' Storer notes.\\n\\'Sparkling wines enhance the flavor and experience of the dishes and the experience of the meal,\\' adds Lieberman. \\'My favorite sparkling wine is champagne blanc de blancs brut nature—an elegant, refined sparkling wine with a crisp, clean taste and delicate bubbles. This sophisticated wine pairs beautifully with extravagant dishes such as lobster and caviar. Additionally, it complements lighter dishes like scallops and oysters or salmon tartare.\\'\\nAlternatively, Lieberman continues, a sparkling shiraz or lambrusco can add an exciting twist to pasta and white meat dishes, creating a delightful contrast of flavors and textures.\\nAll that said, sparkling wine—such as crémant made in France or sekt in Germany and Austria—should always be included when you want to celebrate a bit extra. Champagne is the most famous style, certainly, but sparkling wine is produced in a range of styles and sweetness levels.\\n\\'Bubbles are refreshing for the palate and an enjoyable drinking experience that awakens the senses and makes you smile,\\' Blackwell-Calvert says. \\'For truly special occasions, choose premium sparkling wine styles labeled brut or extra brut as the residual sugar levels are the most versatile with a wide range of food types—not too sweet nor astringently dry for most guests.\\'',\n",

       "   'excerpt': \"The Stirling prize-winning duo's new St Pancras Campus of homes and offices in London is a triumph of attention to detail. It could also be their last new-build, they tell us, as they focus on…\",\n",
       "   'summary': \"Many architects like to say that they practise attention to detail. (As, you may say, they should.) Sometimes this statement is a form of faint self-praise, a signal not to expect too much more from their work, an excuse for being a bit dull. Not so with Adam Caruso and Peter St John. 'We spend a lot of time on the detail,' says the latter. 'That's what we enjoy and that's what we expect every project to have.' But their preoccupation is not dutiful. It's what makes their projects zing. It makes the spaces they design richer and curiouser than they would otherwise be. If you experience a kind of heightened attention in their architecture, that's because they put it there.\\nTheir attitude has, over the past 34 years, made their practice, Caruso St John, one of the best of their generation. It has also led them to be somewhat estranged from the land where they set up their business, Britain, whose commercial culture is not always conducive to subtlety and care. 'Developers are too powerful in this country,' says Caruso (who is Canadian), 'and everything is deliberately upped in terms of crudity and brashness.' The duo, who have offices in London and Zurich, have thrived better in continental European nations – Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and France – where city planners use 'proper competition systems' to raise the quality of architecture.\\nIn Britain, Caruso St John tend to get confined to niches, such as work for Oxbridge colleges and with historic and artistic buildings, 'where people really care about how buildings are built'. Here, they won the Stirling prize in 2016 with their Newport Street Gallery in south London, a conversion of listed industrial buildings for Damien Hirst. In other countries they are entrusted with large office and apartment buildings – the places, that is to say, where many of us spend most of our lives.\\nIt is only now that they are completing their first such development in the UK, the 24,000 sq metre, £101m St Pancras Campus, London. It's also 'probably the last', says Caruso. Like many architects, they want to minimise the carbon emissions that come with new building and wherever possible reuse old ones. In their recent Royale Belge project, for example, they opened up a 1970s office block in Brussels to public use with a dramatic circulating space cut out of its centre.\\nThe St Pancras Campus is on a site formerly of industrial sheds in a zone where the building boom of the King's Cross area encounters the quieter residential streets of the borough of Camden – terraces that retain some of the dusty aura of the films that were shot around here in the days when this area still embodied urban grit. There's a canal nearby and remnants of manufacturing. There are collisions of scales and histories, of which Caruso St John's design seeks to make sense. The new development, they say, is 'arguably too big for its site', so they have put 'a lot of energy' into breaking up its bulk.\\nThanks in part to the influence of the borough of Camden's planners, the project is not a monolithic office building but a city block, a place of several uses and social groups, gathered around shared spaces that are accessible to everyone. It has flats, both for social and market rent, some retail, and as much new industrial space as was demolished. A broad route crosses the site, with a lush little garden by Jonathan Cook Landscape Architects in its centre and a covered street serving the workshops running off to one side. The office lobby, a muscular space of steel columns and beams, is available to the public, and comes with a cafe attached. This is the kind of city-making that architects dream of but don't often achieve: an array of compressed and generous spaces with the multiplicity and openness of beloved towns from the past.\\nThe whole is unified by the design of the fabric and facades, with a palette of reddish stone and white concrete that echoes the brick and stucco of the neighbouring houses. A gridded pattern is applied to both offices and homes, but with changes in scale and treatment to reflect their different uses. It is enriched with touches of material pleasure – glazed green bricks that glisten in the shadowy parts of the complex, and rough, corduroy-like fluting on one face of the otherwise smooth pillars. The architects enjoy playing with the apparent substance of the construction; sometimes it looks like pure surface, as flat as can be, at other times carved and solid.\\nTheir attention to detail extends inside, even to the interiors of the lifts, and to the 'fanciest affordable housing lobby in London', with green ribbed tiles and a patterned terrazzo floor. The walls of the office lobby are lined with timber slats, painted on their edges to look green from one direction and purple from another. Everything feels made and intended, and finished with a high degree of precision. It is a speculative building treated with the artistry of a gallery; a work of London urban vernacular translated into Swiss.\\nIn Arbroath, Scotland, Caruso St John have recently finished the latest phase of a project much more typical of their British commission – a patient, thoughtful renewal of a historic location dedicated to art. This is Hospitalfield, a large Victorian house grafted on to medieval fragments, the creation of the painter Patrick Allan Fraser and his wife, Elizabeth Fraser, after whose deaths it was bequeathed 'for the promotion of education in the arts'. Its style is piled-up baronial with details all of its own, much-turreted and many-gabled, a bold and eccentric stitched-together composite.\\nIt is now used for artists' residencies, with the public welcomed into its gardens, which have been revived and enriched by the landscape designer Nigel Dunnett, and (on tours) into the house. Here, the architects have been working with Hospitalfield's director, Lucy Byatt, for (so far) 10 years, both to open it up more and to rescue it from decades of neglect. They have restored a 19th-century fern house and designed a cafe next door in similar glassy style. They have renovated studios and designed a new one, and added some functional necessities. Planned for the future are a courtyard of rooms for visitors to stay, and a gallery to display collections and new work. It is a work of architectural gardening that 'brings each part of the site to life', as the architects put it, 'and allows things to regenerate'.\\nSome of Caruso St John's intervention is so discreet you'd hardly know it's there; some is about growing new architecture from the inner wonkiness of the old. The fern house and cafe, for example, look at first sight like regular greenhouses, except that the irregularities of the existing stone walls are allowed to push the new work into unexpected angles. The most striking addition is the new studio, a pale, tiled shed amplified by the castle's spirit of exaggeration. It is made only of essentials – eaves, rafters, gutters, cladding, two big windows; the adjustments necessary to fit on to old walls – but each has its own punchy character. This lightweight construction is as different as can be from its masonry surroundings, but it still seems to belong.\\nWhat connects a commercial block in London to a quietly delightful arts centre in the county of Angus is attention not only to detail but to what Caruso St John call 'the circumstances' of a project, to its what and where as well as its how. Both respond to their location and use, and as result are completely different from each other. These architects have no preconceived idea of what a building should look like, and they know when to hold back and let a place speak for itself. Which is not to say that they are shy and retiring – a work like St Pancras Campus is uningratiating, metaphorically spiky, none too anxious to please.\\nNow they relish the prospect of putting renovation at the centre of their work. 'We're not doing competitions for new buildings now,' says Caruso. 'I really don't see the point. Also I don't know what one would do, I don't know what's interesting.' If the St Pancras project really is their new-build swansong, it's not a bad way to finish off.\\nNew Art Gallery Walsall\\nWest Midlands, 2000\\nThis 30-metre off-kilter cube was Caruso St John's breakout success, reshaping Walsall's skyline and putting the young architects firmly on the map.\\nBrick House\\nWestbourne Grove, London, 2005\\nEarning them a spot on the Stirling Prize shortlist, the radically asymmetrical Brick House was designed to occupy a particularly awkward plot of land, squeezed between earlier residential buildings.\\nNewport Street Gallery\\nVauxhall, London, 2015\\nThe practice finally won the Stirling prize 10 years later with this loving conversion of numerous existing industrial buildings, originally as a London home for Damien Hirst's art collection.\\nRoyale Belge\\nBrussels, 2023\\nShowcasing their developing preference for renovating old buildings over creating new ones from scratch, this mammoth undertaking saw Caruso St John repurposing and updating a gigantic modernist office block on the outskirts of Brussels.

       "   'summary': 'JLGutierrez/E+ via Getty Images\\n\"We can draw lessons from the past, but we cannot live in it.\" -\\nLyndon B Johnson\\nCURRENT MACRO VIEW\\nUS economic activity remained solid in 1H24, although there has been some degree of slowing-most notably in the labor market (lower hiring rate, declining job vacancies, rising unemployment rate). The large downward revisions (-818k) to the jobs figures for the 12 months ending March 2024 should confirm that the labor market\\'s strength was overstated. While slower than expected, the revisions moved the monthly pace of job gains down to a still healthy monthly pace of 174k-a far cry from what we were told, but not forecasting a recession-like outcome.\\nWhile still elevated, inflation also moved in the right direction after the brief scare earlier this year. With consumers pushing back on price hikes and promotional activity increasing, further disinflation is likely. The point is that the economy is slowing, but it is not at risk of collapsing. So, the \"growth scare\" we experienced earlier this month has now transitioned back to a view that a soft landing still appears to be the most likely outcome.\\nWe haven\\'t discussed the sentiment surveys much lately, but the recent recovery rally has pushed bullish sentiment as measured by the AAII Sentiment Survey back above 50%. Historically, this survey has served as a contrarian indicator as the forward 12-month performance for the S&P 500 is flat and positive 60% of the time, following bullish readings above 50% dating back to 1987. As we approach the election, bullish sentiment, softening economic data, weak seasonal patterns, and potential policy rhetoric will likely lead to equity volatility in the coming months.\\nConsistent with softening economic data and a material decline in interest rates, there has been a defensive tilt to performance over the last month as defensives (Healthcare, Utilities, Staples, and Real Estate) have outperformed the overall market. We\\'ve seen new highs forged in the Healthcare sector, and it remains one of my top defensive selections due to troughing EPS growth. It also has the most attractive price-to-earnings growth ratio of all sectors.\\nThe FED\\nFor over a year, policymakers have pondered when to start easing their interest rate policy stance. It appears the stars have aligned for investors. With cooler inflation, a slowing economy, and a questionable labor market, the first-rate cut is on the table next week.\\nThe minutes of the recent FOMC meetings showed a \\'vast majority\\' of Fed officials thought it would be appropriate to cut rates at the next meeting in September. They indicated that their emphasis switched from inflation to the potential downside risks to employment. With policymakers onboard with a rate cut on 9/18, the path forward becomes more about the destination and how officials cut rates to get there. Markets are priced for an aggressive and front-loaded easing cycle with four cuts this year and nine total through 2025, with the notion that the first cut could be 50 basis points.\\nInvestors should be careful what they wish for. There have only been 14 rate-cutting cycles in history, so that is a small sample size. However, the data indicates that the equity market would rather see the Fed take the stairway down rather than jump into the elevator. Too much, too fast, can indicate an economy on the verge of collapsing. If we are now concentrating on the employment scene, it is probably time to start the easing cycle. I\\'m not in the camp that any of this will be a \"game changer\" for the market. As stated in earlier reports, no matter what the Fed does for the remainder of this year, it will not affect the economy until late 2025. In essence, this economy is on its own until then. Due to the wide disparity in platforms, the election results will determine the path of the economy and market as we enter 2025.\\nThe good news is that the Fed has plenty of room to ease if needed. The bad news is that if they have to cut rates fast, the economy is deteriorating rapidly. Given the latest commentary from Chair Powell, the Fed has already announced they will act in September, and in my view, it will be a 25 basis point cut. Since the indices are flirting near new all-time highs, I wouldn\\'t be shocked to see the rate cut become a \"sell the news\" event. From there, the Fed will likely return to the \"data dependent\" jargon instead of laying out any further cutting plans.\\nThe ELECTION\\nWhat a difference a few months can make. Just two months ago, former President Trump appeared to be sailing to victory as betting markets reflected a ~70% chance of a Trump win. However, with Biden stepping down and Vice President Harris securing the Democratic nomination, the election is now a toss-up-polling and betting markets signaling an extremely tight race. If there is anything the market does not like, it is uncertainty-particularly with valuations in the upper decile relative to history.\\nLooking back through history, open elections (two non-incumbent candidates running for the presidency) have led to increased volatility with the S&P 500 down ~3% on average and negative ~70% of the time from now until the election. As each candidate expands his/her policy platform moving forward (e.g., Harris\\' tax hike proposal and Biden\\'s agenda, Trump tariffs), volatility will likely remain elevated heading into election day.\\nElection Years (www.StockTradersAlmanac.com)\\nAfter the election, stocks tended to rally into the end of the year after shaking off the pre-election weakness. As always, we should not over-emphasize seasonality and prior cycles, but it\\'s something to remember. Given the vast differences in \"platforms,\" this year\\'s post-election market will depend on the election outcome, with \"taxes\" being the catalyst.\\nEARNINGS\\nI recently laid out a case for why Corporate America remained resilient since the pandemic, and with Q2 in the books, corporate fundamentals remained on solid ground. S&P 500 earnings were rising fastest (+11.3% YoY) since 4Q21. Earnings broadened beyond mega-cap tech, with S&P 500 exMAGMAN earnings rising meaningfully into positive territory in 2Q-the first time in two years. However, forward-looking estimates have been revised lower with a broad set of CEOs signaling a soft start to 3Q-particularly in travel spend and home improvement. The post-Covid spending spree is slowly ending.\\nEPS (www.factset.com)\\nWhile mega-cap tech earnings have been resilient, S&P 500 ex-MAGMAN 3Q24 EPS estimates have been cut ~7% over the last three months, bringing the growth rate from 8% at the start of earnings season to ~1-2% today. While earnings are expected to broaden moving forward, slowing economic activity may weigh on forward estimates-particularly 2025 EPS estimates that have been largely unscathed up to this point and are likely overly optimistic.\\nThe MARKETS\\nThe equity market has had smooth sailing to start the year-with the S&P 500 up ~18%, logging record high after record high, and only enduring one 9.7% peak-to-trough drawdown through August. This is calm relative to history, as the S&P 500 typically experiences 3 to 4%- 5% pullbacks on average per year and a max intra-year drawdown of ~13%. However, recent price action has been a reminder that volatility remains a part of the fabric of the market. The sharp rebound in recent weeks is a reminder that panic selling during periods of volatility is often a detriment to performance, and those investors with \"time\" on their side should stick to their long-term plan. With upcoming negative seasonality (September is historically the worst month of the year) and continued economic and political uncertainty, volatility will be part of the scene.\\nS&P (www.bespokepremium.com)\\nThe graphic indicates how we have transitioned from smooth sailing to a more difficult, volatile scene today.\\nSEASONALITY\\nAugust is over, and the next few months is likely to give investors some reason for caution. As noted, seasonality at the end of summer has historically been weak, but September has been even worse.\\nSeasonality (www.bespokepremium.com)\\nOver the past 100 years, September has by far been the worst month of the year, with an average decline of 1.24%, as it is also the only month in which the index has fallen the majority of the time. Similarly, over just the past 50 years, the Dow has averaged a decline of over 1% with positive returns barely more than a third of the time. Zeroing in more recently to the past 20 years, September is again weak, but other months like January, May, June, and August have seen worse average returns.\\nAs of Friday\\'s close, the major indices are slightly below the flatline except for the Russell 2000 small caps (-1.5%). This September will either be \"different,\" or investors are about to see more volatility and weakness ahead.\\nSENTIMENT\\nThe Investors Intelligence survey saw the percentage of respondents reporting as bullish rise to 53.2%, the highest level since the end of July. Right before the 8-9% pullback. Meanwhile, the NAAIM Exposure Index likewise pointed to investment managers raising equity exposure to the highest level of the month.\\nTypically, elevated readings in investor sentiment have been followed by weaker-than-normal returns. Forward returns for the S&P 500 have been considerably weaker across these instances, especially for three and twelve months out.\\nThe Trading Week\\nComing off the worst week for the S&P in 18 months and the worst start to a September in 20+ years, the \"lower prices\" attracted buyers as trading began on Monday. The S&P 500 gained 1.16% on the day, with strong breadth as every sector was higher. Consumer Discretionary and Industrials led the way higher, with each sector gaining over 1.5%. The Nasdaq gained an identical amount to the S&P 500,, and the Russell 2,000 underperformed with a 0.3% rally.\\nIt was a mixed session on Tuesday as investors seemed to be waiting for any catalyst to take the indices higher or lower. The S&P 500 built on Monday\\'s gains as it rose 0.45%. While the small-cap Russell 2,000 was marginally lower, the Nasdaq outperformed with a 0.84% gain. Real Estate, Consumer Discretionary, and Tech all gained over 1%. Energy and Financials were the worst performers. Energy\\'s weakness came as the price of WTI took another big leg lower, falling 3.52% to settle at $66.28, which, according to some, is a sign of a global recession brewing.\\nI\\'ve said that volatility would be with us going forward, but what occurred on Wednesday was one for the record books. The S&P 500 opened at 5496 and went downhill fast until buyers turned the scene around. The S&P closed at 5554, up 1% on the day-a 148-point turnaround off the lows. However, that was nothing compared to the DJIA and the NASDAQ Composite. The former saw a trading range of 900 points, while the latter experienced a 700-point swing. The indices closed up 0.37% and 2.3%, respectively.\\nOn Thursday, the S&P meandered around at the open before buying pressure mounted, pushing the index to another nice 0.75% gain. The Nasdaq outperformed, rising 1%, as did the small-cap Russell 2,000, which jumped 1.22%. Every sector was higher, with Communication Services the best performer, rising ~2%. Consumer Discretionary also posted a 1+% gain. In the last two days, money has also moved into gold, silver, and uranium.\\nThe BULLS put the cherry on top of the cake as the rally extended for the fifth day in a row on Friday. Every index and all eleven sectors saw gains. After one of the poorest weeks to start the month of September, the equity market turned it around, with the S&P recording a ~3.5% gain for the week. Despite the rally this week, it left the S&P (5625) right where it was before the selling began (5648). The same can be said for the NASDAQ Composite. There has been a lot of action in the last two weeks with limited results, leaving many investors frustrated by the volatility.\\nTHE ECONOMY\\nDifferent month - same results (perhaps worse) for the Small Business community.\\nThis week\\'s NFIB Small Business Optimism Index showed disappointing results. The index was expected to show a small decline, with the index forecasted to fall 0.1 points month over month to 93.6. Instead, the decline was much more dramatic, as it fell to 91.2, erasing all of the summer gains. One factor likely at play that we have noted in the past is political sensitivities.\\nThis is the 32nd consecutive month below the 50-year average of 98. The Uncertainty Index rose to 92, its highest level since October 2020. Inflation remains the top issue among small business owners, with 24% of owners reporting it as their top small business operating issue, down one point from July.\\nNFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg;\\n\"The mood on Main Street worsened in August. Historically high inflation remains the top issue for owners as sales expectations plummet and cost pressures increase. Uncertainty among small business owners continues to rise as expectations for future business conditions worsen.\"\\nINFLATION\\nThe August CPI report showed a rise of 0.2% overall and a core increase of 0.3%, the latter on the hotter side. These follow gains of 0.2% for both in July. The 12-month headline pace slowed to 2.5% y/y in August, down from 2.9% y/y previously and the slowest rate since February 2021.\\nInvestors shared opinions trying to decide if the Fed would cut rates by 25 or 50 bps next week. Despite WTI rebounding, the energy sector (XLE) lost 0.95%.\\nPPI came in higher than expected on both a headline (0.2% vs 0.1%) and core basis (0.3% vs 0.2%), but the year-over-year readings were both in line with forecasts, as July\\'s report was revised lower.\\nJobless claims, meanwhile, were largely in line with forecasts. Initial claims came in 4K higher than expected (230K vs 226K) while continuing claims were right in line.\\nThe Global Scene\\nThe European Central Bank statement this week;\\n\"The Governing Council today decided to lower the deposit facility rate - the rate through which it steers the monetary policy stance - by 25 basis points. Based on the Governing Council\\'s updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, it is now appropriate to take another step in moderating the degree of monetary policy restriction.\\nRecent inflation data have come in broadly as expected, and the latest ECB staff projections confirm the previous inflation outlook. Staff see headline inflation averaging 2.5% in 2024, 2.2% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026, as in the June projections. Inflation is expected to rise again in the latter part of this year, partly because previous sharp falls in energy prices will drop out of the annual rates.\\nInflation should then decline towards our target over the second half of next year. For core inflation, the projections for 2024 and 2025 have been revised up slightly, as services inflation has been higher than expected. At the same time, staff continue to expect a rapid decline in core inflation, from 2.9% this year to 2.3% in 2025 and 2.0% in 2026.\"\\nMACROECONOMY\\nThis section presents a series of issues that may not necessarily impact the market today but can pose problems for the MACRO scene.\\nThe SPENDING on the Green Agenda is a Bonfire that Uses Money as Fuel.\\nThe Anti-green movement has always been based on common sense. The proposed changes and mandates will continue to make a minuscule difference in the global climate. The technology isn\\'t yet available for it to make a difference, and the lack of results confirms that.\\nThe latest data also indicates that humans aren\\'t about to change Mother Nature. Last year, the Canadian wildfires released four times more carbon into the atmosphere than global aviation. NASA reported that the five-month-long fires added more carbon to the atmosphere than Germany, Russia, or Japan in 2022. This data only represents what occurred in Canada, the US, and other areas prone to wildfires, and it\\'s easy to see Mother Nature is in control.\\nWhile utilizing technology to limit carbon emissions has been worthwhile in the private sector, government climate mandates are nothing more than extremes that will cost trillions with no return on investment-trillions that can no longer be justified. They must either be severely scaled back or remain a ball and chain around the economy\\'s ankle.\\nSEMICONDUCTORS will lead the Next Revolution\\nThe U.S. makes only 12% of the world\\'s chips, a steep decline from 37% in the 1990s. In the more critical and profitable advanced designs, foundries in Asia produce over 90% of these chips. Every American should be fully aligned to strengthen American manufacturing and supply chains, enabling U.S. companies to compete more effectively and reverse these trends.\\nSome consider the Administration\\'s bipartisan CHIPS Act a worthwhile endeavor, but it\\'s another example of the government picking winners and losers. History has already told us that this never works out well. It may also produce unintended consequences that not many are talking about. The CHIPS Act funding is going to the nation\\'s largest chip companies, the same companies that lost their competitive edge to TSMC and Samsung in the first place.\\nIt\\'s a pipe dream to believe these large companies will now catch up to their Asian counterparts. Ironically, an administration that is all about breaking up large corporations and providing competition avoided assistance to help smaller U.S. companies-companies that can provide the innovation behind key technologies of tomorrow and manufacture domestically. Recent developments confirm that view.\\nIntel received 20 billion in taxpayer funds, and the administration touted that it would be a great investment in jobs. As it turns out, there will be no such job creation. Despite the windfall, Intel announced it will cut 15% of its workforce or ~15,000 jobs.\\nBesides that, creating US jobs wasn\\'t Intel\\'s high priority the administration thought it would be. Intel already had plans to \"offshore\" production in Germany, but those plans are being scrapped because of the company\\'s dire financial position. If you give Congress money through additional taxes, they will find a way to spend it. The problem is compounded when that money becomes part of the \"Burning Bonfire.\"\\nThe Treasury Department reported Thursday that the U.S. government has spent more than $1 trillion this year on interest payments on its $35.3 trillion national debt, the first time in history. That should signal that there can be no tolerance for further spending that doesn\\'t produce results, but that message has been ignored.\\nIt should be very obvious what needs to be cut and what needs to be totally eliminated. Keep receiving existing Social Security benefits or see a windmill farm built in Oklahoma?\\nA choice that may have to be made; the existing path is unsustainable.\\nThe Daily chart of the S&P 500 (SPY)\\nAfter a breakdown appeared imminent, five straight days of gains (with plenty of volatility thrown in) for the S&P 500 have the index ready to challenge the July Highs.\\nS&P 500 (www.freestockcharts.com)\\nThe S&P is once again at the crossroads. The index now faces a choice: It can run to new highs on STRONG price action like we saw this week or drop back into the trading range on WEAK price action like we witnessed in the prior week.

       "   'excerpt': \"Always prone to natural disasters, the country's plight has worsened, and not only because of the climate crisis\",\n",
       "   'summary': \"On 10 May 2024, Haroon Nafas was in his family's guesthouse in Baghlan, north Afghanistan, spending time with friends who had come to stay. It had been raining lightly all through the afternoon, but at about 3pm the group heard a loud crashing noise.\\n'We immediately went outside to see what was causing the sound,' says Nafas. 'Initially, we were confused, thinking it might have been a plane. But then we realised, no, it's a flood.'\\nNafas rushed home to his own house, which fortunately was located up on a hillside, and started gathering his family. Meanwhile, several town members sought shelter atop the local mosque, including Nafas's brothers, who used a mulberry tree to climb on to the roof and reach safety.\\nOthers were not so lucky. 'The flood was very severe, maybe up to 30 metres high,' says Nafas. 'People were even dragged in from the roofs of certain buildings. The damage from the waters spread several kilometres. Some households lost up to 11 family members.'\\nOver two days, at least 315 people were killed in Baghlan and more than 2,000 homes destroyed. About 1,600 people were injured, and hundreds more were missing. Flash floods also wreaked havoc in other provinces across Afghanistan, with at least 50 people killed in Ghor.\\nAfghanistan has always been prone to natural disasters. Among low-income nations, it ranked second in the number of deaths caused by them between 1980 and 2015, according to one report. However, the frequency and extremity of disasters such as flash flooding is on the rise, and climate breakdown is not solely responsible for these changes. The country's history of armed conflict has exacerbated the situation severely.\\nDr Najibullah Sadid, an environmental researcher and water resources expert based in Germany, says it is crucial that warring parties are held more accountable as toxic artillery often gets left behind and damages the environment. Explosives can damage ecosystems, disrupt biodiversity and weaken soil structure, and can damage groundwater resources.\\nAccording to a report by the Progressive magazine, the US dropped more than 85,000 bombs on Afghanistan between 2001 and 2021. In spots where massive ordnance air blast bombs, nicknamed 'the mother of all bombs', were dropped, such as Nangarhar province, scientists have found that plant yields halved due to the spread of toxins. Such toxins can also be carried to other regions by the wind or in water.\\nMine contamination is another problem. As of 2021, only one of Afghanistan's 34 provinces had ever (temporarily) been declared mine-free. The remaining 33 provinces still have explosive ordnance scattered across them. Despite this, funding for the country's mine action sector has been declining, from $113m (£86m) in 2011 to $32m in 2020. The Taliban takeover in August 2021 has threatened these streams further, as many donors remain reluctant to engage with the new government, despite improved operating conditions and access to previously unreachable locations. According to the United Nations Mine Action Service about 45,000 Afghan civilians have been killed or wounded by landmines since 1989.\\nSadid says the mines have a direct connection to the recent flash floods: 'Landmines [and] de-mining activity disrupt soil structure. Disrupt this, and you are basically exposing the soil to erosion. The debris flow in Baghlan, for example, can be linked to war because the floods originated from a valley which is completely dry.'\\nConflict-caused deforestation also worsens flash floods. In 1970, Afghanistan had 2.8m hectares (6.9m acres) of forest, covering 4.5% of the country. By 2016, this had shrunk to about 1.5%. In Nuristan, a province in eastern Afghanistan, forest cover had reduced by 53% in that time.\\n'Vegetation retains a lot of rainwater,' says Sadid. 'When there is no forest, the land becomes exposed to landslides, and the runoff increases. That's why we now see very extreme flash floods occurring in some parts of Afghanistan.'\\nFor Sayed Abdul Baset, a disaster risk reduction expert and Herat resident, the issue hits close to home. The former adviser to the Afghan government says there is still an opportunity to unite and mobilise despite the problems caused by climate breakdown.\\n'These natural disasters are related to the activities of the land,' he says. 'They show how unsafe our homes are, how weak our coping capacity and early warning systems are. We don't have water pipes. The topography of the soil is not good. There is no flood zoning. People live in floodplains. It is a very painful picture. It is no less than a war.'\\nSohila Akbari, who is based in Herat, has been leading humanitarian efforts as part of a 12-woman team for more than a decade.\\nWith financial contributions collected from the Afghan diaspora and donors abroad, her grassroots organisation Committee Akbari regularly distributes emergency aid such as food, clothes and tents to the city's poorest and disaster-struck.\\n'I first started interacting with those struggling through my work as a teacher,' says Akbari. 'Slowly, I started to develop an interest in finding other ways to help. I've since connected with Afghans all over to try to take the work further.'\\nAkbari was herself a victim of the devastating series of earthquakes that hit Herat in October 2023, killing more than 2,000 people. 'It was a very horrible day. We hadn't experienced an earthquake in years. It took us all by surprise.'\\nShe recalls hearing a horrible noise that resembled explosions. 'You couldn't even stand. The ground would go out from under you. Our house was on the third floor so it was especially bad. I remember telling the children to run, just run. Don't worry about me. They ran. I was in the stairwell when the ceiling caved. I thought I was finished.'\\nThey spent the next few days seeking shelter in a local school. After two days, Akbari resumed her distribution efforts to those who had been most severely affected.\\n'We are in the city. What else can we do if we don't help? We will do our best. What little we can do, we will do it,' she says.\\nIt is through locals such as Akbari, who are already familiar with the people affected, that aid can have the most successful outcome, says the longtime climate journalist Laurie Goering.\\n'This is the giant question in climate finance right now. How do you actually move such big amounts of money from governments and organisations to those women in Afghanistan? Taking advantage of local systems and actors, and finding intermediary groups to get more of that money to where it's needed is really important,' Goering says.\\nSign up to Down to Earth\\nThe planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential\\nafter newsletter promotion\\nAs for how much compensation warring states owe for the destruction caused in Afghanistan, Goering refers to the United Nations Development Programme's loss and damage fund as a good place to start. This is a new fund aimed at helping impoverished nations cope with the damage caused by climate-induced natural disasters. Support will be offered in the form of grants.\\n'The fund is designed to help communities and countries recover from things they couldn't have adapted to,' says Goering. 'So that money would be really useful in places like Afghanistan.'\\nSince their rise to power in August 2021, the Taliban have remained excluded from the global stage. For Goering, this poses an extra challenge: 'It's hard to get funds if you're excluded from international systems. There's a lot of thinking at the moment about how to move money to very vulnerable places without going through the government.'\\nDespite Afghanistan being one of the countries most vulnerable to global heating, due to its arid climate, mountainous topography and reliance on agriculture, it was once again excluded from the Cop28 climate talks last year, something Goering says is problematic.\\n'Afghanistan doesn't have high emissions,' she says. 'This is something that's happening globally, that everybody must work on together. Otherwise, we won't solve the problem.'\\nIt is a sentiment shared by Rahmani, who believes support from international institutions and existing data could go a long way: 'We need to create a roadmap for each region of Afghanistan. Also, 60% of Afghans are young. They can be taught. With a very small budget, they can be provided with employment, education and training in the climate field.'\\nHowever, to truly muster the potential of younger generations, Rahmani admits better climate awareness is a crucial first step: 'People think that this is God's will, that because of our sins, these disasters happen to us and that we can't do anything about it. Such beliefs and social behaviours have a lot of impact.'\\nRahmani also hopes to see more remediation from warring parties, as well as high-emitting nations.\\n'These countries have a responsibility,' he says. 'This is happening because of them. Places like the United States, England, Brazil and China – they keep their industry alive with fossil fuels and adapt themselves and raise their resilience. But for Afghanistan, which is currently very limited in terms of global relations, those conditions are completely closed.'\\nIn March, the UN security council voted to extend its mission in Afghanistan for another year, but this is focused mostly on the humanitarian crisis rather than climate impacts.\\nThere is also an ongoing parliamentary inquiry in the Netherlands on the impact of the Dutch and Nato's 20-year intervention in Afghanistan. Similar initiatives by other countries embedded in the Nato campaign could accelerate reparations and aid.\\nFor Rahmani, prioritising smart policies and expanding irrigation projects, such as those implemented in recent years across Nangarhar province, is the way to go.\\n'We had a very large climate project a while ago, backed by millions of dollars. But unfortunately, all the work is suspended. We need funds. These are very serious issues. It is very necessary for the people of the world to be united so that we can solve these problems.'\\nSince the Taliban takeover in 2021, large-scale conflict has reduced significantly. According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, no new conflict displacement was recorded in 2023. However, by the end of that year, there were still 1.5 million people internally displaced as a result of natural disasters.\\nFor Baghlan resident Nafas, the most pressing need for those affected is clean water. He hopes the humanitarian response offers a solution before the situation on the ground worsens.\\n'The tap systems have all been damaged,' he says. 'All the canals are covered with mud. There is no drinking water, no water for ablution, for people's livestock, for agriculture. Incomes have also been suspended. People are living in makeshift tents. It's chaos. It is hot now but soon the cold season will come.'\\nInterviewees' names have been changed to protect their identities.\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': \"Rivalries in Italy take the country's flair for nicknames to tender and tasty places\",\n",
       "   'summary': \"What's in a nickname?\\nThat is a question The Athletic has been answering this week as we trace the origins of football clubs' monikers in England, Germany, France, Spain and the rest of the world.\\nThis time, we're looking at the nicknames — flattering and otherwise — in Italian football.\\nMore on the intriguing world of nicknames in football…\\nLet's begin with a deep cut. A lombata if you're familiar with Italian butchery. Rivalries in Italy take the country's flair for nicknames to tender and tasty places. It's not enough to know the colour scheme of a jersey (Biancocelesti, Rossoneri, Giallorossi), a local landmark (a fountain, a volcano, sometimes both) or a spirit animal (Ascoli's is the woodpecker) to appreciate their flair for nicknames.\\nYou need to really get under the skin.\\nSampdoria, for instance, have arguably the most beautiful jersey not just in Italy, but the world. There's no sash, no stripes, no checks. The blue base layer with the white, red and black hoop (Blucerchiato) is unique in football.\\nTo neighbours Genoa, however, their 'cousins' do not belong in this sport. They deridingly call them ciclisti. That's right. Cyclists because the jersey resembles the kind of garb Fausto Coppi used to wear as he wound his way up the Stelvio Pass. (In retaliation, Samp fans look at the mythological griffin on Genoa's old crest with the same disdain Roma supporters show when faced with Lazio's imperial eagle. They both mock these proud-winged creatures as a piccione; a shabby pigeon.)\\nStaying with Roma, they are nicknamed La Magica (isn't it magical at the Olimpico when they're playing?) or Lupi, the wolf being as prevalent in Italian football as foxes are in London gardens. The she-wolf and her place in the Eternal City's origin story is the pack leader of lupi in Italy — better than those of Avellino, Cosenza and the one pawing underneath an oak tree on Lecce's badge.\\nLecce, incidentally, are better known as the Salentini for the stretch of the Otranto coastline on Italy's heel. Puglia is home to Foggia as well, whose nickname is the Satanelli or Little Satans, a variation of AC Milan's nickname the Diavolo for whom the club's founder Herbert Kilpin is to thank. A Nottingham lad, Kilpin promised Milan would be a team of devils, 'red like fire and black like the fear we'll invoke in our opponents'.\\nSan Siro room-mates Inter are characterised by the Biscione, a basilisk that somehow slithered its way off the coat of arms of some Milanese nobles. When Inter signed Darko Pancev, a European Cup-winning forward from Red Star Belgrade in 1992, it seemed like a marriage made in heaven as he was called the Cobra, but his performances at the Giuseppe Meazza were so venom-less he quickly became referred to as Ramarro; the grass snake.\\nInter, for what it's worth, also go by Beneamata (well-loved or fondly thought of) although it would be wrong to suggest they are thought of that way in Turin where their bitterest enemies reside. Inter fans aren't the only ones to adapt Juventus to Rubentus and create a neologism out of the verb rubare, which means to steal.\\nTorino fans claim their team is more rooted in Turin — much like Manchester City fans do with Manchester — and this Maroon Eleven identify with the city's icon, a prancing bull, as their spirit animal. In addition to Rubentus, fans of Il Toro will lean into calling Juventus hunchbacks or Gobbi, as will Fiorentina, a reference to Juventus kits from the 1950s that billowed at the back and made their players look like Quasimodos who, in Italian folklore, are considered absurdly lucky.\\nMore charitable and less contested names for Juventus will follow. It's not her fault if the Girlfriend of Italy, as the club is also known, attracts as much envy as she does love.\\nDon't worry, though, she can handle herself, as can Atalanta, a heroine and huntress from Greek mythology. Quite how the Dea (Goddess) has let Bournemouth copy her look without releasing an arrow in anger is a mystery.\\nFor a region that gave Italy its unifying language, Tuscany isn't particularly verbose, at least when it comes to nicknames for its clubs. Fiorentina are simply known as the Viola (purple), Empoli the Azzurri (blues), Pisa the Nerazzurri (black and blues; why not the Towers?!). Livorno occasionally go by the Triglie, literally the Mullets, although this is a reference to one of the city's most famous dishes, which features red mullet (and shares in the colour of their jerseys) rather than the hairstyle.\\nCrossing the Apennines into Emilia-Romagna, the relatively few enthusiasts for Etruscan civilisation in commentary booths talk about Bologna as the Felsinei, an ancient sect probably responsible for some of the artefacts dug up by the troubled British archaeologist-turned-looter in Alice Rohrwacher's recent arthouse film La chimera.\\nWhen Parma were workshopping a jersey in 1914, the founders settled on the city's links with the Crusades rather than classical music and Giuseppe Verdi. And so the cross they bear is one of the go-to monikers people reach for — Crociati — when they aren't calling them the Gialloblu (the yellow and blues).\\nAnother team in those colours, Hellas Verona, is spoken about as the Butei although you won't find any peach emojis on their social media. Butei is Veneto-dialect for 'the lads' and it isn't Hellas' only nickname. Their crest is like that of Verona's medieval rulers, the Scalas, showing a ladder (literally a Scala, hence their nickname Gli Scaligeri) and a couple of fierce-looking mastiffs (Mastini, another of their nicknames).\\nElsewhere, Cagliari have been anointed the team of Sardinia, no matter the protests from Olbia or Torres, which means they are either known by the local dialect name of their city Casteddu or simply as the Sardi or Sardinians. Up by the Slovenian border, Udinese are also proud representatives of their region, Friuli, so you'll hear Friulani more than Zebrette, which indicates the Zebra-like stripes they have in common with Juventus who we return to, along with some of the other interestingly nicknamed clubs, below. Juventus\\nNickname: La Vecchia Signora (The Old Lady)\\nYou can see her behind the goal at the Allianz Stadium, twirling in the Scirea end. Lady Juventus. The Contessa. The Nonna. Depicted in a flag held up by one of the banner-men among the ultras, she means different things to different people.\\nHow she came to be identified with a club whose name is Latin for 'youth' is one of life's paradoxes. But when the Agnelli family bought the team a century ago, it felt like Italy's girlfriend, as Juventus were also known for their popularity, became a lady. Whether she has aged gracefully over the years is in the eye of the beholder.\\nThe club's tendency, in the past, to have a veteran core and faithful servants who played into their forties meant a nickname needed to counterbalance the dissonance with the actual name. However, the recent contributions from their Next Gen reserves in the first team have ensured Juventus are truer to their original moniker than ever before. Venezia\\nNickname: The Lagunari (Lagooners)\\nVenezia could perhaps have been called l'Arsenale. The city was famous, at least until the Corsican who gave his name to short-man syndrome pillaged it, for the armoury that weaponised ships for the various doges to annex large swathes of the Dalmatian coast and islands of the Ionian and Aegean seas. But Venezia was the name some gymnasts settled on when they decided to swap parallel bars for goalposts and form a football club in 1907.\\nStill, an unintentional hat-tip to Arsenal lives on in Venezia's sobriquet. As with other football clubs up and down Italy, yet weirdly not Como — who should be known as the Lakers — a landmark is used in association. In this case, it's the Venetian lagoon on which Vaporettis speed to the islands of Murano and Burano. Instead of the Gooners, Venezia are the Lagunari instead — the 'Lagooners'. Napoli\\nNickname: O Ciuccio (The Donkey)\\nYou will almost always hear Napoli referred to as the Partenopei. This goes back to the city's origin story as an Ancient Greek settlement by the name Partenope, which is the title of the Neapolitan film director Paolo Sorrentino's upcoming film. But in the rust bowl that is the Maradona, it is not uncommon to see the club's spirit animal: a braying, flea-bitten donkey known, in local dialect, as O Ciuccio.\\nBack in the day, Napoli's first, rather ornate crest featured a horse prancing on a football. Think of a less iconic version of the Ferrari one. Terrible in their inaugural season as a club — Inter thrashed Napoli 9-2 then Juventus gave them an 8-0 hiding — it has passed into folklore that, one day, a group of fans were standing in Bar Pippone lamenting Napoli's latest defeat when a local rag-and-bone man walked past with a donkey pulling a cart. 'Prancing horse,' they scoffed. 'Yeah right! More like Fechella's donkey with his sores and his festering tail.'\\nA reporter at the Corriere del Mezzogiorno picked up on fans calling the team a donkey while covering games and committed the nickname to print. All of a sudden Fechella's mule became beloved so much so that he was paraded around the pitch after Napoli came back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 against Juventus in 1930. The team of Ferrari's future owners Fiat, Juventus, with all their horsepower, had miraculously been caught by a donkey.\\nO Ciuccio has inspired 'hit' songs like this from when Napoli regained their top-flight status and began to qualify for Europe again under current owner Aurelio De Laurentiis.\\nO Ciuccio is not to be confused with the Flying Donkeys of Chievo Verona. In other ass-related sobriquets, this one came about when Chievo, a team from a suburb of Verona, incredibly began climbing up the Italian football pyramid. Fans of Hellas, the 1985 Scudetto winners, liked to say donkeys would fly before they played a derby in Serie A. But in 2001, it happened and although Chievo lost the first one, they won the next Derby della Scala and finished an incredible fifth in their debut season in the top flight. Benevento\\nNickname: The Sorcerers\\nShakespeare set 10 of his plays in Italy. He could perhaps have staged Macbeth in Benevento. 'Double, double, toil and trouble' resembles this supposed spell from the Campanian town: 'Nguento, 'nguento, manname a lu nocio 'e Beneviento, sott'a ll'acqua e sotto o viento, sotto a ogne maletiempo.' Stories about a coven of witches gathering underneath a walnut tree in Benevento have been passed down since the 13th century. They'd steal horses and fly around, however, these necromancers suffered a blow in the 1940s when a bridge they supposedly used to get airborne was destroyed during World War II.\\nStill, it didn't stop them from being a complete nuisance. Locals would pour a goal line of salt along the threshold of their house or lay a broom across it to stop the janaras, as they were known, from entering. By the time they'd counted every grain or fibre, it would be sunrise and the witches were at risk of melting.\\nThis seemed to explain why Benevento or, to give them their nickname the Sorcerers, lost their first 14 games in Serie A in 2017. The bright lights of Serie A were too much. Crotone\\nNickname: The Pythagoreans\\nFootball is about angles and whether or not you can manipulate geometry to your advantage. It attracts philosophers and, more recently, nerds who come up with equations that explain the inexplicable, such as the value of various spaces in a rectangle. Unfortunately, none of this is relevant when telling the story of why Crotone are known as the Pitagorici or Pythagoreans.\\nAs was the case with Naples and many other parts of the south of Italy and Sicily, Crotone was a Greek colony by the name of Kroton, which sounds like a planet on which superheroes are born. In fact, there is a crater on Mars named after this Calabrian town.\\nBefore dying because he refused to run through a field of fava beans — if you're wondering, they filled him with more mortal dread than the men Polycrates had sent in pursuit of him — the philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras opened a school in Kroton.\\nIt did not have the influence on Italian football that Coverciano did on the leafy outskirts of Florence (that's where coaches do their badges in Italy) but Davide Nicola did manage the equivalent of solving one of those unsolvable math problems when 34 points somehow equalled an improbable top-flight survival in 2017.\\n(Top image: Designed by Eamonn Dalton)\",\n",

Inflation data in Canada and the UK should play second fiddle to Wednesday's FOMC decision.

       "   'summary': \"Jim Farley had just returned from China. What the Ford Motor chief executive found during the May visit made him anxious: The local automakers were pulling away in the electric-vehicle race.\\nIn an early-morning call with fellow board member John Thornton, an exasperated Farley unloaded.\\nThe Chinese carmakers are moving at light speed, he told Thornton, a former Goldman Sachs executive who spent years as a senior banker in China. They are using artificial intelligence and other tech in cars that is unlike anything available in the U.S. These Chinese EV makers are using a low-cost supply base to undercut the competition on price, offering slick digital features and aggressively expanding to overseas markets.\\n'John, this is an existential threat,' Farley said.\\nFor years, Tesla was the main source of consternation for auto CEOs trying to tackle a transition to electric vehicles. Now, it is the rapid rise of nimble automakers in China that have rattled executives from Detroit to Germany and Japan. Even Tesla's Elon Musk recently called the Chinese the 'most competitive' carmakers in the world.\\nIn the span of a few years, Chinese EV maker BYD, backed by Warren Buffett, and other domestic brands have clawed away gobs of market share in China from once-dominant foreign rivals, through a combination of lower prices, high-tech interiors and rapid vehicle updates. Today, they are quickly expanding in Europe, the Middle East and other Asian markets.\\nIn the U.S., carmakers see EVs as their future, but for now, EV sales growth has slowed, as high prices and charging hassles turn off some shoppers.\\nShortly after the trip, Farley arranged to have Chinese EVs shipped to Michigan for executives and directors to check out and sit in. The models were displayed in a Ford conference center near its headquarters. During board-meeting coffee breaks, directors took turns fiddling with cars.\\nOne was the first EV from smartphone giant Xiaomi, which has drawn comparisons to a Porsche and sells for $30,000 to $40,000, below Ford's similarly sized Mustang Mach-E SUV. The Xiaomi has a fragrance diffuser and an infotainment system that can connect to devices inside the home when the car approaches—turning on the home lights or air conditioner, for example.\\nThere was also a $77,000 futuristic-looking electric minivan from Li Auto. The plush seats in the rear rows have heated arm and leg rests, and massive multimedia screens controlled by hand gestures. Ford brass compared the setup to business-class air travel or a home theater.\\n'Executing to a Chinese standard is going to be the most important priority,' Farley said.\\nChinese brands have so far been kept out of the U.S. by steep tariffs, geopolitical tensions and regulatory hurdles. But some have established a toehold in Mexico, where China-built vehicles—both EVs and combustion-engine vehicles—now account for about 20% of sales.\\nGovernments around the world are worried about China's EV expansion, citing everything from potential job losses to data-security concerns. In the European Union, where Chinese imports make up about one-fifth of electric sales, regulators recently disclosed plans for tariffs up to nearly 50%. The Biden administration went further with a roughly 100% tariff.\\nFarley, a 62-year-old, blunt-talking car fanatic who spent the early part of his career in marketing at Toyota Motor, sees Chinese EVs as an immediate threat in Europe and other overseas markets, and a long-term risk in Ford's profit engine of North America, regardless of protectionist measures.\\nFarley often reminds his executive team of how Toyota and other Japanese car companies grabbed market share from the U.S. automakers in the 1980s and 1990s, followed in recent decades by Korea's Hyundai and Kia, which have found success with EVs.\\n'I've seen this movie before,' said Farley, who has been Ford's CEO for four years.\\nA few humbling trips to China in the past 18 months prompted Farley to alter his EV strategy.\\nOn a visit to China last year, he watched engineers dissect an electric car from Chinese juggernaut BYD to reveal elegant, low-cost engineering. A spin around a test track in another China-branded EV left him blown away by the car's ride quality and high-tech features.\\nThose experiences persuaded Farley to narrow Ford's focus in China to commercial vehicles, rather than trying to compete with local manufacturers in its consumer market. Now, he is racing to fend off the threat of Chinese EVs elsewhere—in part by borrowing from them.\\nThe CEO has a team exploring ways to contract with some of the same low-cost parts suppliers that have given Chinese EV makers such a big edge. He has pivoted Ford's strategy toward smaller EVs, because for now the huge batteries needed for big pickups and SUVs are too expensive. That strategic shift resulted in the recent, high-profile cancellation of a future Ford Explorer-size electric SUV.\\nFord is developing a low-cost mechanical layout to serve as the foundation for several future EVs. Among the first will be a midsize pickup truck due to arrive in 2027.\\nFarley sees the China threat as a test of his efforts to change Ford's culture and make his people move faster.\\n'Either he can make us uncomfortable, or we can wait, and the Chinese can make us uncomfortable,' said Doug Field, a former Tesla and Apple executive hired in 2021 to lead Ford's technical transformation.\\nFor decades, Ford and other global carmakers did not view Chinese automakers as much of a threat.\\nChina opened its auto market to foreign companies in the 1980s under the condition that they enter joint ventures with fledgling state-owned carmakers. The local manufacturers mostly played little-sibling roles to their foreign JV partners, helping them to navigate red tape and providing some capital to build factories.\\nMeanwhile, Beijing was methodically investing in a plan to leapfrog global carmakers through a move to electric cars. The government offered generous subsidies for car companies to build EVs, and for consumers to buy them. Huge investment into car chargers also nurtured the EV market.\\nBy early this decade, those once-shaky Chinese companies—joined by a few hundred startups—had begun churning out stylish, affordable EVs. BYD in particular pulled away from the pack, selling more than three million electric and plug-in-hybrid cars last year, nearly seven times higher than in 2019.\\nBYD's cheapest EV, the Seagull, starts around $10,000 and features a fashionable cabin; a rotating, iPad-like touch screen; and more than 300 miles of driving range, comparable to EVs from legacy automakers that are priced three times higher. It is currently for sale in China and Latin America and BYD plans to start selling it in Europe next year for around $20,000.\\nIn early 2023, Farley made his first trip to China since it reopened after years of pandemic restrictions. He sat in the driver seat of an electric SUV from Ford's longtime joint-venture partner, Changan Automobile, which for years had been a middling player in China, its market share hovering around 5%.\\nFarley, who races vintage cars and has an encyclopedic knowledge of car models, thrashed the EV around Changan's sprawling test track in central China, as Ford Chief Financial Officer John Lawler rode shotgun. Afterward the executives sat silently, stunned at the progress Changan had made. The ride was smooth and quiet and the cabin upscale, with easy-to-use technology.\\n'Jim, this is nothing like before,' Lawler told Farley after the drive. 'These guys are ahead of us.'\\nFarley was born in Buenos Aires. His father was a banker, and the family relocated many times. He also had some Detroit roots: His grandfather joined Ford in 1913 as a factory worker.\\nA big Steve Jobs fan, Farley says his favorite photo of the Apple founder shows him crouched and peering into an office to watch a worker on a Macintosh computer in the 1980s.\\nAs a young marketer at Toyota, Farley spent a year on the road doing research for a new Camry sedan, chatting up car owners in store parking lots.\\n'He's just constantly scanning the market,' said Ted Cannis, the head of Ford's commercial-vehicle business. Cannis said last year he was caught off guard when Farley asked him about a new, China-built commercial van that had barely registered on the U.K. sales charts.\\n'I'm completely distrusting of research,' Farley said in a recent interview. 'I like watching what people do. See where they spend their money.'\\nA first cousin of the late comedian Chris Farley, he has embraced the limelight during his four years as CEO. He hosts a podcast that has featured Tom Brady and Sydney Sweeney, and has taken Jimmy Fallon out on the racetrack. He is prolific on social media, sometimes bantering with Elon Musk.\\nHe can be brusque and intense in meetings. Farley has been known to interrupt people midsentence and tell them to 'stop admiring the problem' and come up with a solution, executives who have worked with him say.\\nJon Huntsman, a longtime Ford director, said Farley is not a polished glad-hander or a 'prototypical CEO.' 'He's distrustful until you earn his trust,' Huntsman said. 'He's brutally honest, to the point of being offensive.'\\nDuring a Morgan Stanley investor conference last year, Farley was asked what superpower he would choose.\\n'Kindness,' Farley said. 'I'd like to be more kind.'\\nFord's EV transition has been made more challenging by quality problems and costly recalls. Farley said things have improved recently after Ford tied worker bonuses to vehicle-quality metrics.\\nFollowing early buzz for the F-150 Lightning pickup, which lifted the stock price, fading consumer interest in EVs led to pricing pressure and heavy red ink. Ford is on pace to lose about $5 billion on EVs this year, equal to as much as half of its projected operating profit.\\nFarley says erasing those losses is his top priority. 'The sense of urgency is so high because the $5 billion loss is so visible,' Farley said.\\nThat test-track run in early 2023 convinced Farley and Lawler to give up on trying to reclaim Ford's status as a major player in China. Ford is using China primarily to export vehicles to other markets. Farley has vowed to apply lessons from China elsewhere before the Chinese pull ahead again.\\nFarley said he is confident that the team working on the new EV tech—led by another former Tesla engineer—can erase the cost gap with the Chinese EV makers. If that effort is successful, Farley said he believes Ford's expertise in trucks, off-road vehicles and the commercial market will give it an edge.\\nFor a company that sells huge pickups and SUVs for $70,000, offering an EV for a fraction of that price requires some tough calls to keep costs in check.\\nOne day this past summer, Farley walked through Ford's design studio near the company's headquarters to check the status of several future EVs. One prototype seemed like it would be at home in China's family-centric car market. It featured a configurable rear seating area with seats that can swivel to create a meeting space.\\nFarley and Field huddled around a laptop, looking at a spreadsheet of line items for the future midsize electric pickup. The goal: figure out how to extract $800 in cost.\\nThe team had overachieved on the driving range by 16 miles, Field explained, which meant they could wring out about $500 by shrinking the battery. Finding the rest of the savings would be a slog. Would it really need a heated steering wheel? Maybe the front trunk was expendable, one of the execs suggested.\\nBefore long, Farley worried aloud that they might be cutting too many corners, and that 'the product could end up being really sh—y.' He suggested to Field an informal process: How about they slap sticky notes all over the prototype to hash out what should go?\\n'Then let's get 20 people who we all trust in a room,' Farley said. 'And we argue about it.'\\nBen Glickman contributed to this article.\\nWrite to Mike Colias at mike.colias@wsj.com\",\n",

       "  'excerpt': 'Ban on using optional payments to cover costs or boost profits has bosses, and their staff, worried',\n",
       "  'summary': \"Restaurants are wondering whether to put up food and drink prices or risk legal action over the sharing of tips and service charge payments with workers as new legislation comes in this week.\\nTaxi firms, hairdressers and hotels, as well as restaurants, pubs and cafes, will be banned from withholding tips paid by customers – whether in cash or by card – and service charge payments from workers. The legislation is being introduced by the government on Tuesday, more than eight years after a ban was first proposed.\\nThe law is designed to boost the earnings of about 2 million waiting staff and other hospitality workers, and follows a series of exposés, many in the Guardian and the Observer, about companies deducting money intended for waiting and kitchen staff from customers' card payments.\\nInstead of passing on the service charge, chains including the luxury Ivy Collection have chosen to bump up workers' hourly pay rate by a set amount, no matter how much is collected during their working hours.\\nMany businesses have already adjusted their tips policy in the face of pressure from customers to ensure the service charge goes to the workers. However, some are still using the optional payment from clients to boost their profits, and one London chain, Ping Pong, introduced a 'brand' fee instead of a service charge before the new rules came in.\\nWith some hospitality businesses automatically adding as much as 15% in service charge – leaving it to customers to opt out – there can be substantial sums at stake. A 2022 survey by industry body UK Hospitality found that up to a fifth of businesses were keeping a share of the service charge to help cover their costs.\\nKate Nicholls, the chief executive of UK Hospitality, says businesses have 'been gradually getting ready for this' and moving towards a code of best practice endorsed by unions.\\nHowever, many restaurants struggling with the higher minimum wage and persistent food inflation will have little choice but to recoup costs related to the new legislation by increasing menu prices, reducing portion sizes or cutting costs elsewhere.\\n'Those that have been using the service charge to pay staff or to partly offset their wage bill are still going to have to pay their staff, but now won't be able to draw on this cash fund,' says Saxon Moseley, head of leisure and hospitality at consultancy RSM. 'And in that scenario, margins will be hit, in some cases fairly drastically.'\\nMeanwhile lawyers say some businesses are struggling to agree the terms of a 'fair' share of tips. Michael Powner, employment partner at Charles Russell Speechlys, says reaching a deal is often a difficult process: 'Employers need to ensure that what is agreed is 'fair' and that there is rational reasoning in place, while avoiding any potentially discriminatory rules.' Difficult areas, he says, could include whether the tips should be shared with those on maternity or sickness absence and, if so, for how long.\\nBryan Simpson, who organises hospitality staff for the Unite union, said he was concerned about businesses imposing unelected individuals and senior managers as heads of tip-pooling committees. He said some chain were 'deliberately misinterpreting the new fair tips legislation to suit business needs rather than the workers'.\\n'We will be doing everything in our power industrially, politically and legally to ensure that any unfair tipping policy is challenged,' he said.\\nSome workers already fear they may unexpectedly lose out as a result of the new rules, rather than gaining new rights to optional payments from clients.\\nAt Pizza Express, which has faced particular scrutiny over its approach to the distribution of tips, waiters will now have to share their cut of the service charge with salaried managers and shift managers after the chain deemed that the senior staff were legally bound to be included because they occasionally needed to step in and wait on tables.\\nThe restaurant does not levy a service charge unless a table is made up of seven people or more. It uses a 'tronc' pooling system to share out the service charge and voluntary tips to staff. The precise sharing of tips is voted on by a staff committee led by a 'troncmaster'.\\nIn order to fund that change, the group has reduced waiters' share of the tips to 68% from 70% and that will now also be shared with managers who wait tables. Non-waiters – largely kitchen staff – will share the remaining 32%.\\nIt is understood that the company plans to review the policy in January and every three months after that.\\nThe owner of the Ivy has previously said: 'All cash or credit card tips are kept directly by the member or members of the team who received the tip.'\",\n",

       "  'excerpt': \"Financial disparities in friendships can create conflict where it shouldn't exist. Here's how two friends navigated a growing wealth gap.\",\n",
       "  'summary': \"Adult friendships aren't easy to maintain. Busy schedules and competing demands interfere with making time for friends. And when money is involved, friendships can become even more complicated.\\nSimple activities, like going out to dinner or getting drinks, can quickly turn awkward. Bigger decisions, such as sharing an apartment or taking a joint vacation, are even more fraught, especially when one friend has deeper pockets than the other.\\n'Money brings up a lot,' said Aja Evans, a financial therapist and the author of 'Feel-Good Finance.' 'It brings up a fear of being misunderstood, rejected and judged.'\\nFinancial disparities in friendships can create an unease where one shouldn't exist, especially when people conflate their net worth with their self-worth.\\n'That's why it's so uncomfortable,' said Anna Goldfarb, the author of 'Modern Friendship: How to Nurture Our Most Valued Connections.' 'You might be OK with your parents paying for something, but a friend paying for you can feel strange because the power dynamic will feel off.'\\nThe relationship between power and money can also highlight broader social issues and disparities. 'It can call attention to differences in privilege and issues with bias and discrimination,' said Ms. Evans, 'and this may strain the friendship further.'\\nHowever, not all financially disparate friendships are doomed. Natalie Vallot, 49, and Hilah Johnson, 44, have been friends for over two decades. In 2010, Ms. Johnson started a YouTube cooking show, 'Hilah Cooking.' When the show took off, so did her income. As Ms. Vallot struggled financially to get through nursing school, the two had to navigate a growing wealth gap. Here's how they did it.\\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\\nWhat were your finances like when you met?\\nMs. Johnson: Natalie, I feel like you were the rich one when we first met.\\nMs. Vallot: I was making $18 an hour.\\nJohnson: You were making more per hour than any of us. You would always float us at the bar. You were the rich one for the first 13 years of our friendship. I was really good at being frugal, though.\\nWere there hard feelings over your income disparity?\\nJohnson: Not really. Nat was always very generous. If I couldn't afford to go out, she'd be like, 'Come out, I'll cover you.' So I didn't ever feel like I was being a burden. I mean, it's not like I was ordering top shelf or anything. I wasn't going to take advantage.\\nWhen did finances start to shift for you?\\nVallot: Around 2010, I quit being a nanny and went back to school for nursing. So it was a struggle for a while. Me and my husband Billy were definitely at our poorest at that point.\\nJohnson: And right when you went back to school, that's when my YouTube channel began taking off. In 2011, I was making enough to quit my day job.\\nWhen did you realize you didn't have to worry about money anymore?\\nJohnson: My partner and producer Chris and I wanted to buy furniture as a backdrop for some food photography. So we went to Ikea and spent $300 on a chest. It wasn't cheap. It was the good Ikea stuff. We put it on a business credit card because it was a business expense, and I remember thinking, 'Oh, I do have some money now.' And that was weird.\\nAround this time, you two were in very different financial circumstances. Did this disparity lead to any awkward situations?\\nVallot: When I turned 40, all our friends wanted me and my husband to celebrate in Hawaii. And we couldn't afford it, so our friends bankrolled us. I remember a friend saying, 'How much can you all afford?' and I told her my number, and she said, 'OK, that's how much you're paying.' That was nice. But my friends just subsidized and subsidized.\\nJohnson: My approach to money is I feel like it's all going to come out in the wash, as long as nobody feels like they're getting taken advantage of. For the Hawaii trip, I remember thinking, this is what we have to do for Natalie. I was happy to pitch in because I wanted y'all to go. And it was your 40th birthday, and we had so much fun. It would be dumb if you weren't allowed to go because you couldn't afford it.\\nDid you feel weird about it?\\nVallot: I did at first. I think it does make you try to behave yourself. Like, we all went to the grocery store to pick out the food we wanted for the trip, and I was like, 'I'll eat whatever.' I didn't feel like I had a say because everyone else was paying for it. But I'm kind of like that, anyway, I'm flexible. Once we got there I realized, we're all here, and these are my sisters.\\nI wonder if it helps that you seem to have shared values when it comes to money?\\nJohnson: I just don't think that the amount of money you have is inherently tied to who you are as a person or your value as a person. That's a completely ridiculous idea. And maybe the fact that everyone in our friend group feels that way is what makes it easier to share it and not worry about it.\\nWhat advice do you have for other friends dealing with financial issues?\\nVallot: Give what you want to get back. I totally forgot that I was the moneybags when I was a nanny.\\nJohnson: I think, also, to be honest about what you can afford. Just say, 'I can't afford that. Can we pick something cheaper? Here's my budget, can you all work within that?' If your friends want to spend time with you, nobody's going to object. Don't be afraid to say, 'That's a little too pricey for me.'\\nHave you ever argued about money?\\nJohnson: No, and I think there might be two more reasons we've never argued over money. One is that we've never lived together or had a relationship where one person's money choices affected the other person's life.\\nAnd the second is that we've never borrowed or lent money between us. Everything has been given freely, with no expectations or strings attached. What's that old axiom about not lending money you can't afford to lose? I think we've always followed that, too.\\nVallot: I absolutely agree. I think respect is required to pull friendships through challenges, but having similar values is what grounds us.\",\n",

The bad news is that insurance industry claims adjusters could still be overwhelmed by the scale of the storm and its aftermath.\\nThere is no escaping the fact that you'll be in a long line of people with claims. But being organized — and knowledgeable — should help.\\nHere are some resources to consider:\\nAnn Carrns's guide to filing a homeowners insurance claim is here. This article by Tara Siegel Bernard explains why standard homeowners and renters insurance may not cover flooding, and Ann Carrns has a similar article from 2021 here. Christopher Flavelle has a recent post that explains how the overhaul of the federal flood insurance program caused many homeowners to drop their coverage.\\nDuring past hurricanes, The New York Times published many stories about what it was like to fight an insurance company for a higher payment — or any at all. They are still useful.\\nHere is a Your Money column by Ron Lieber from 2012 about the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy — and an article by Tara from 2013 about that same storm. Yes, the fallout and the fights over damages can last for years. A 2022 article about the aftermath of Hurricane Ida in Louisiana tells a similar tale.\\nIf you live elsewhere and are scared by what you're seeing, Tara's guide to preparing for the next big storm should help. Ann has a column on how to shop for flood insurance, and in a separate article, she explains why hail claims are on the rise and what you should know about coverage.\\nHere, Emily Flitter chronicles why it's so hard to keep decent coverage when premiums are rising.\\nKeep in mind that insurers are dropping people or shutting down in areas where you might not expect them to. Christopher's article about where this is happening and why might surprise you. You can look up rates in your area via his interactive feature here.\\nIn the wake of yet another large storm, it may become even harder for people to afford home insurance. An article from 2022 explains why this is a trend that seems to have no end in sight.

       "  'summary': \"Inflation cooled in August, the latest sign of progress in the Federal Reserve's yearslong fight to bring rapid price increases back under control.\\nThe Personal Consumption Expenditures index climbed by 2.2 percent from a year earlier, data released Friday showed. That is down from 2.5 percent in July and slightly softer than economist forecasts. It was the slowest annual inflation reading since early 2021.\\nAfter stripping out volatile food and fuel prices for a better sense of the underlying inflation trend, a 'core' price index was a bit more stubborn on an annual basis. The core measure came in at 2.7 percent, up from 2.6 percent previously and in line with what economists had expected. But comparing prices from month to month, core inflation slowed to a modest 0.1 percent in August.\\nAltogether, the report offers further proof that price increases are swiftly fading. Already, that has allowed the Fed to begin to lower interest rates from a more than two-decade high of 5.3 percent. After raising borrowing costs sharply and then holding them at a high level to slow the economy and weigh down inflation, officials voted last week to cut rates by a larger-than-usual half percentage point. Policymakers also signaled that more rate cuts are coming, as long as inflation continues to fade.\\nThe Fed's pivot is already helping to bring down mortgage rates, and it could slowly trickle through the economy to stop the job market from slowing more markedly. Central bankers are trying to pull off a rare 'soft landing,' in which they cool conditions enough to wrangle price increases without tempering them so much that unemployment spikes and the economy falls into a recession.\\nThere were some signs that the economy may be pulling back — but not crashing — in the details of Friday's report. Consumer spending, which makes up a big part of overall economic activity, grew more slowly in August, the data showed. And personal incomes picked up less than expected.\\nFed officials have been struggling to figure out what is happening with the economy, as overall growth and consumption numbers look strong but the job market slows.\\n'While a softening labor market suggests a weakening of economic activity, other economic measures suggest ongoing strength,' Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said in a recent essay. But overall, 'it seems as though a continuation of inflation moderation and economic resilience is the most likely scenario,' he added.\\nFriday's inflation figures come after a Consumer Price Index report earlier this month also cooled. That measure, which provides a more timely reading on inflation using a different methodology, is now down to 2.5 percent from a peak of 9.1 percent in 2022. The Personal Consumption Expenditures measure peaked at a more muted 7.1 percent.\\nChristopher Waller, a Fed governor, suggested during an interview on CNBC last week that he might be willing to cut rates more rapidly if inflation slows notably in the months ahead.\\n'If the data starts coming in soft and continues to come in soft,' he said, he would be willing 'to be aggressive on rate cuts to get inflation closer to our target of 2 percent.'\",\n",

       "  'summary': \"Rupert Murdoch's REA Group has made a fourth attempt to buy Rightmove, increasing its offer to £6.2bn as it stepped up its pursuit of the UK's largest online property portal.\\nThe Australian property group, which is controlled by News Corp, raised its cash and shares offer from the £6.1bn offered earlier this week and called on Rightmove's board to 'engage now' after they repeatedly refused to meet the suitor.\\nRightmove has rejected three previous non-binding cash and shares approaches from REA this month, calling them 'unattractive' and saying the offers 'fundamentally undervalue' the company.\\nIn its latest offer, REA sweetened its cash and shares proposal with terms valuing each Rightmove share at 781p, and the entire company at about £6.2bn. Its initial proposed bid of 705p in early September had valued Rightmove at £5.6bn, before it made subsequent bids worth £5.9bn and £6.1bn.\\nREA's latest approach means that for each share, Rightmove investors would receive 346p in cash and 0.0417 new REA shares and a special dividend of 6p in cash in lieu of any final dividend.\\nIn a statement, REA expressed 'disappointment and surprise' at the repeated rejections by Rightmove and appealed directly to the UK company's shareholders to persuade them to back the deal before the formal deadline of 30 September.\\nREA said there had been no 'substantive engagement' from Rightmove's executives beyond 'cursory procedural telephone calls' with Rightmove's chair, Andrew Fisher.\\nREA has until 30 September to make a firm offer or walk away. The bidder has pressed for an extension to the deadline, and said that extra time should be granted by the Rightmove board to permit further engagement.\\nThe company urged investors to 'use what little time remains ahead [of the Monday deadline] to make their views known to the board of directors of Rightmove'.\\nIn 2001 Rupert Murdoch's son Lachlan took control of REA, buying a 44% stake in the struggling Australian property company for A$2m (£1.3m).\\nSince the Murdochs sold some of their media crown jewels and Rupert retired from leadership of the rest last year, the property company has taken on greater importance for News Corp.\\nThe investment is seen as one of Lachlan's key contributions to the family's wealth. Rupert is taking legal action to try to hand control of News Corp to Lachlan, who is thought to share his rightwing political views.\\nAnalysts have said REA's pursuit of Rightmove, which controls more than 80% of the UK online property market, is opportunistic and undervalues the business, as the UK property market is rebounding.\\nSign up to Business Today\\nGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning\\nafter newsletter promotion\\nRightmove has more than 1 million properties advertised each month. It raises cash by charging estate agents subscription fees to list properties, as well as selling other services.\\nRightmove and Zoopla, the second-biggest company in the sector, are facing stiffer competition after the US property company CoStar bought OnTheMarket last October.\\nREA has said, if it acquired Rightmove, it would give the company a secondary listing on the London Stock Exchange to enable a wider pool of investors to gain exposure to the digital property company on the LSE.\\nREA owns a number of property websites in Australia including realestate.com.au, property.com.au and the data company PropTrack, as well as brands in India and the US. It previously tried to expand into the UK but sold that operation to Zoopla in 2009.\\nOwen Wilson, the chief executive of REA, said: 'We continue to see the potential for us to strengthen Rightmove and accelerate its growth. This is a compelling opportunity to create a true global technology leader on the London market via a secondary listing, operating in two of the most attractive markets in the world.'\\nShares in Rightmove, which has yet to respond to the latest approach, fell 1% to 658p on Friday.\",\n",

'Nick Read did ask about his pay and bonus opportunity more than I might have expected.'\\nIn February, it emerged that Henry Staunton, the former chair of the Post Office, twice asked the government for Read's pay to be doubled.\\nHowever, the requests were refused by Kevin Hollinrake, the Conservative MP and then Post Office minister, who said that as a publicly owned asset under huge financial pressure it was not justified.\\nThe Post Office announced this month that Read would step down as CEO in March next year, five and a half years after being appointed to the role. He had already temporarily stepped back from his role in July to give his 'entire attention' to preparing for his own appearance at the inquiry next month.\\nEarlier this year Jane Davies, the former chief people officer at the Post Office, said Read asked repeatedly for pay increases in an 'obsession' with remuneration.\\nThe inquiry has heard that the pay requests to the government came from Staunton, who wanted to ensure Read would remain in post given the lower levels of remuneration compared with the wider commercial market.\\nIn 2022-23, Read was paid £573,000, including bonuses.

       "  'summary': \"An abrupt move by China's leaders to prime the economy with stimulus has produced a powerful rally in the country's stocks, which have posted their biggest single-week gain in nearly 16 years.\\nBy midday on Friday, the CSI 300 index of big Chinese companies traded in Shanghai or Shenzhen was up 14.9 percent this week. The strong performance included an increase of 3.8 percent in trading on Friday.\\nThe gain has been the largest in a single week for the index since November 2008, when share prices were gyrating violently with the onset of the global financial crisis.\\nThe volatile Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong, which includes a range of companies with activities in Hong Kong and in mainland China, was also up 12.9 percent so far this week.\\nThe increases pulled the mainland Chinese CSI 300 index into positive territory for the year and have sent Hong Kong stocks rocketing 21 percent higher in 2024. Those are big turnarounds for markets that have been lagging those in other parts of Asia and the United States for well over a year.\\nSharp gains in China could shore up public confidence, at least temporarily, as the Chinese economy faces broadly falling prices, weak retail sales and a housing meltdown. The government has been trying to rebuild confidence to persuade consumers and home buyers to start spending money.\\nOn Tuesday, China's top financial regulators announced a package of measures, including interest rate cuts and requiring smaller mortgage down payments. One of the changes took effect on Friday: allowing commercial banks to lend a larger proportion of their assets.\\nShares got a particular boost on Tuesday when regulators said at a news conference that banks would be allowed to lend heavily to companies to repurchase their shares, as well as to major shareholders to buy larger stakes in companies. Both moves could provide stronger financial support for stock purchases and help elevate share prices.\\nThe next day, the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the Ministry of Finance announced that local governments would be expected to make one-time payments to the needy before the start of a weeklong national holiday on Tuesday.\\n'While the exact size and scope of the handout are still unknown, it marks a new willingness by the government to provide direct relief to the very poor,' said Andy Chen, an economics consultant in Beijing.\\nChina's Politburo, the two dozen men who lead the ruling Communist Party, met on Thursday and called for further action to help the economy, without providing much detail.\\nSteps mandated in the Politburo statement were vaguely phrased, but appeared to signal a further willingness to use government money to stabilize financial markets and the economy.\\n'We must work hard to boost the capital market, vigorously guide medium- and long-term funds into the market, and clear the bottlenecks for social security, insurance, wealth management and other funds to enter the market,' said the statement, which also called for stabilizing the real estate market.\\nEconomists are divided on whether China will use the planned distribution of money to the poor as the starting point for a broader program to expand the social safety net and increase the role of consumer spending in the Chinese economy. Xi Jinping, China's top leader, has expressed considerable wariness over the years about greater government support payments to the poor.\\nHe warned three years ago that China 'must not aim too high or go overboard with social security, and steer clear of the idleness-breeding trap of welfarism.'\",\n",

Its managing director for water, Tim Mcmahon, told the FT: 'Nevertheless, it's right that we work with regulators to consider all possibilities into the mid 2030s.'\\nThe Environment Agency is understood to be in contact with Norwegian regulators about the plan, which the agency believes reflects the company's delayed delivery of crucial supply schemes.\\nThe agency will review Southern's proposed options, including sea tankering from Norway, through a public consultation and consider the environmental acceptability of this.\\nIt expects the company to reduce reliance, as part of its drought planning, on taking more water from the River Test in Hampshire, one of the world's most precious chalk streams and designated as a site of special scientific interest, and the River Itchen special area of conservation.\\nWater companies are lobbying regulators to raise bills significantly over the next five years to improve infrastructure. Campaigners argue that consumers have already paid for upgrades that have not been carried out.\\nGreenpeace UK's chief scientist, Doug Parr, said: 'Decades of neglecting its own infrastructure have left Southern Water having to choose between unappealing options as the climate crisis threatens supplies. Causing permanent damage to local ecosystems by taking more water would be a further foolish concession to the short-termism that got us into this mess.\\n'Tankering in huge quantities of water from Norway will inevitably be a costly and carbon-intensive alternative to that of doing a better job with the water resources that are available in a rainy country like the UK … Despite the obvious failings of planning, water companies need to start thinking of potable fresh water as a precious and finite resource, and plan to start treating it as such.'\\nIn July, the chief executive of Southern Water received a £183,000 bonus despite submitting a business plan that was criticised by the industry regulator for England and Wales, Ofwat, and attempting to raise water bills more than any other English water company.\\nSign up to Business Today\\nGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning\\nafter newsletter promotion\\nOfwat said the business plan 'fell short' of minimum expectations and categorised it as 'inadequate'.

The company denies the charge of unlicensed gambling.\\nDeveloped in 2018 by Nicolas Julia and Adrien Montfort, Sorare describes itself as a fantasy sport cryptocurrency-based video game. Players can create their own 'football club' with cards in the form of tradable non-fungible tokens (NFTs), competing for prizes including cash, VIP tickets and signed kits.\\nThe commission said in October 2021 that it was investigating whether the products provided by the Paris-based firm were online gambling and required a licence.\\nAlmost exactly two years later, the regulator has now charged the company with offering unlicensed gambling, with the company due to appear in Birmingham magistrates court.\\nSince it was established in 2005, the Gambling Commission is thought to have used its prosecutorial powers only once, in a case of cheating involving a man who had drugged dogs to fix greyhound races.\\nA spokesperson for Sorare said: 'We are aware of the claims made by the Gambling Commission and have instructed our UK counsel to challenge them. We firmly deny any claims that Sorare is a gambling product under UK laws.\\n'The commission has misunderstood our business and wrongly determined that gambling laws apply to Sorare.

S&P cut its rating on Thames's £15bn top-ranking debt pile by five notches to CCC+, taking it into the triple-C category that is considered very risky. Thames lost its investment-grade credit rating in July.\\nMoody's also slashed the firm's rating by five notches, to Caa1 from Ba2, saying: 'Inability to attract new equity funding may ultimately lead to a creditor-led debt restructuring or one that is imposed as part of a special administration process.'\\nThames is scrambling to shore up its finances, and admitted last week that it faces a shortage of cash as soon as December. The company announced it was seeking fresh repayment terms from its lenders, saying it had only £1.57bn left at the end of August, including £1.15bn of cash.\\nThe debt laden company, which serves 16 million people in and around London, is at the centre of a crisis in Britain's water sector over repeated sewage dumping, crumbling pipe networks and water leaks.\\nIt has already been put into special measures by the water regulator for England and Wales, Ofwat. Without a rescue plan, the watchdog and the UK government may have to put Thames into a special administration regime, a form of renationalisation.\\nS&P said Thames's announcement last week about its finances was contrary to the rating agency's previous expectation in July that liquidity would last the company until May next year.\\nIt added: 'We believe Thames Water is now facing an acute near-term liquidity shortfall, and that, without any material positive developments, the issuer will likely restructure its debt within the next 12 months, which we would likely consider a default.'\\nS&P lowered its ratings on class A and class B debt, to CCC+ and CCC-, from BB and B previously, and assigned a negative outlook to both. Moody's said the utility had a 'significantly tighter liquidity position than previously expected'.\\nSome big lenders are considering easing repayment terms as Thames fights for survival, as they worry about their loans being wiped out if the company is temporarily nationalised.\\nTalks with creditors would only allow for enough funds to last until spring next year. Any agreement would therefore mark just a step on the road to a potential restructuring – staving off the immediate risk of insolvency.\\nThames said: 'The announcement by the credit rating agencies is consistent with our liquidity position set out in our market statement last Friday. We continue to operate to the undertakings agreed with our regulator in July 2024 following the reduction in our class A debt rating to sub-investment grade and we continue to engage with creditors to consider options for the extension of our liquidity runway. Formal discussions with potential equity investors will commence in the coming weeks.'\\nSign up to Business Today\\nGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning\\nafter newsletter promotion\\nSeparately, Pennon Group, which serves more than 4 million water users daily and owns South West Water, said the diarrhoea and vomiting outbreak in Devon in May caused by an outbreak of cryptosporidium parasites, had been resolved.\\nIt cost the company £16m in terms of customer compensation, provision of bottled water over an eight-week period and measures to clean and filter the network. In May, it said it would pay £3.5m in compensation to affected customers.\\nThe supplier also said there had been more sewage spills into waterways through storm overflow spills because of high rainfall – with the third wettest August to October period on record making groundwater levels 'exceptionally high'.\\nPennon said its water conservation campaign had led to customers using less water, which weighed on first-half revenues. It warned of continued lower customer demand at South West Water, offsetting tariff increases and new customer numbers.\",\n",

But it is investing £18bn to produce battery versions of its lineup alongside petrol cars, starting with the first deliveries of the electric Range Rover, made in its main factory in Solihull, in the West Midlands, at the end of next year.\\nThe Halewood plant was first built in 1963 to make the Ford Anglia, which featured as a flying car in a Harry Potter book and film. It produced various Ford models until the Escort was phased out in 2000, making way for Jaguar and then Land Rover when Ford owned the British marques.\\nTata bought them in 2008. Tata is also spending heavily on a new battery factory in Somerset to supply JLR, and on switching its steelworks in Port Talbot, south Wales, to electric technology.\\nThe upgrades to Halewood – including robots and new ovens for drying paint on car bodies – will allow 'parallel production' of battery cars and those with internal combustion engines, allowing the company to respond to shifting demand.

       "  'summary': \"The chairman of Rentokil Initial, the FTSE 100 firm that catches rats and destroys termites, says he is 'delighted to welcome' a representative of Nelson Peltz's Trian Partners on to the board.\\nWhat Richard Solomons means, one suspects, is that Rentokil's standing is so low after a thumping profits warning a fortnight ago that it would be pointless to resist a request for a seat. Never mind that Trian's stake is only 2.26%, and never mind that Peltz, famed for adventures at Heinz, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Disney and more, operates at the aggressive end of the activist investing spectrum. Better to have a shareholder pest on the inside.\\nThe standard Peltz tactic is to agitate for a shake-up, whether in the form of disposals, break-ups, relistings or simply better operational performance. All versions, conceivably, could apply at Rentokil. Its French unit that launders work garments looks an oddity in a company dominated by pest control with a smaller division that cleans offices. And a relisting in the US, to reflect the dominance of Rentokil's stateside revenues these days, is officially kept 'under review' already.\\nBut an operational kick is the priority, as everybody can see. Rentokil in 2021 paid $6.7bn at a fat takeover premium to buy Memphis-based Terminix, market leader in US pest control business. It used the dreaded word 'transformational' to describe a deal that was a departure from its usual diet of bolt-on small acquisitions. The cost savings seem to be arriving as advertised but the shocker a fortnight ago was virtual absence of growth in revenues when, only two months earlier, the company was banging on about 'positive momentum' in US pest control.\\nRentokil had to confess to being 'overresourced in both sales and service', thus the wide miss in profit forecasts. The shares plunged 20% on the day, the sort of move that tends to be remembered – especially if, like Trian, you were stakebuilding just before the warning. Peltz's mood may not be improved by his terrible timing on this occasion.\\nIn theory, the operational troubles are all fixable. It's just that, almost three years after completion of the Terminix purchase, the business is still deep in the territory of branch closures and reorganisation. Meanwhile, its main US-listed rival, Rollins, enjoys a rising share price and 'strong' demand the last time it spoke: no shortage of customers or termites there. The contrast is stark – a point Trian's new boardroom representative, its head of research Brian Baldwin, may be making.\\nAndy Ransom, the Rentokil chief executive since 2013 – so architect of the misfiring Terminix deal but also of Rentokil's previously long and impressive turnaround – will surely be looking over his shoulder.\\nSign up to Business Today\\nGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning\\nafter newsletter promotion\\nPeltz's other current adventure in FTSE 100-land is Unilever, where he took a board position himself in 2022. The problems there were similar ones of execution. Unilever's chief executive at the time, Alan Jope, departed soon afterwards – an exit that, as fund manager Terry Smith observed, required one to suspend disbelief to think was not linked.

       "  'summary': \"Late last year, Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, started pitching an audacious plan that he hoped would create the computing power his company needed to build more powerful artificial intelligence.\\nIn meetings with investors in the United Arab Emirates, computer chip makers in Asia and officials in Washington, he proposed that they unite on a multitrillion-dollar effort to erect new computer chip factories and data centers across the globe, including in the Middle East. Though some participants and regulators balked at parts of the plan, the talks have continued and expanded into Europe and Canada.\\nOpenAI's blueprint for the world's technology future, which was described to The New York Times by nine people close to the company's discussions, would create countless data centers providing a global reservoir of computing power dedicated to building the next generation of A.I.\\nAs far-fetched as it may have seemed, Mr. Altman's campaign showed how in just a few years he has become one of the world's most influential tech executives, able in a span of weeks to gain an audience with Middle Eastern money, Asian manufacturing giants and top U.S. regulators.\\nIt was also a demonstration of the tech industry's determination to accelerate the development of a technology it claims could be as transformative as the Industrial Revolution.\\nWhen word leaked that Mr. Altman, 39, was looking for trillions of dollars, he was mocked for seeking investments equivalent to roughly a quarter of the annual economic output of the United States. Officials in Washington also expressed concerns that a U.S. company was trying to build vital technology in the Middle East. To build A.I. infrastructure in a number of countries, American companies would need approval from United States officials who oversee export controls.\\nMr. Altman has since scaled his ambition down to hundreds of billions of dollars, the nine people said, and hatched a new strategy: Court U.S. government officials by first helping to build data centers in the United States.\\nIt is still unclear how all this would work. OpenAI has tried to assemble a loose federation of companies, including data center builders like Microsoft as well as investors and chipmakers. But the particulars of who would pay the money, who would get it and what they would even build are hazy.\\nAt the same time, OpenAI has been in separate talks to raise $6.5 billion to support its own business, a deal that would value the start-up at $150 billion. The Emirates' technology investment firm, MGX, is among the group of potential investors, which also includes Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple and Tiger Global, three people familiar with the conversations said.\\nOpenAI is seeking cash because its costs far outpace its revenue, the three people said. It annually collects more than $3 billion in sales while spending about $7 billion.\\nSome of OpenAI's plans have been previously reported by Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters. Conversations with the nine people close to the talks, who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media, provide a fuller picture of the efforts and how the strategy has evolved.\\n(The Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft in December for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)\\nIn private conversations, Mr. Altman has compared the world's data centers to electricity, according to three people close to the discussions. As the availability of electricity became more widespread, people found better ways of using it. Mr. Altman hoped to do the same with data centers and eventually make A.I. technologies flow like electricity.\\nChatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT learn their skills by analyzing troves of digital data. But there is a shortage of the chips and data centers that drive this process. If that supply grows, OpenAI believes it can build more powerful A.I. systems.\\nIn dozens of meetings, OpenAI executives have prodded tech companies and investors to expand global computing power, the nine people close to the company's discussions said.\\n'Sam is thinking about how OpenAI remains relevant,' said Daniel Newman, chief executive of the Futurum Group, a tech research firm. 'It needs more compute, more connectivity, more power.'\\nMr. Altman's original plan called for the Emirates to fund the construction of multiple chip-making plants, which can cost as much as $43 billion each. The plan would reduce chip manufacturing costs for companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world's largest chip producer.\\nTSMC makes semiconductors for Nvidia, the leading developer of A.I. chips. The plan would allow Nvidia to churn out more chips. OpenAI and other companies would use those chips in more A.I. data centers.\\nMr. Altman and his colleagues discussed building the data centers in the Emirates, a nation with excess electrical power. In the United States, it has been hard for companies to build new data centers because there is not enough electrical power to run them.\\nOpenAI discussed funding the infrastructure plan with MGX, an A.I.-focused investment vehicle created by the Emirates. It also met with TSMC, Nvidia and another chip company, Samsung.\\nOmar Sultan Al Olama, the Emirates' minister of state for A.I., told The Times in a March interview that there 'is a business case' for going after such a giant deal.\\nNvidia declined to comment. MGX and Samsung did not respond to requests for comment.\\nOpenAI said in a statement that it was focused on building infrastructure in the United States 'with the goals of ensuring the U.S. remains the global leader in innovation, driving re-industrialization across the country and ensuring A.I.'s benefits are widely accessible.'\\nWill Moss, a spokesman for TSMC, said the company was open to discussions about expanding semiconductor development but was concentrating on its current global expansion projects and had 'no new investment plans to disclose at this time.'\\nWhen Mr. Altman visited TSMC's headquarters in Taiwan shortly after he started his fund-raising effort, he told its executives that it would take $7 trillion and many years to build 36 semiconductor plants and additional data centers to fulfill his vision, two people briefed on the conversation said. It was his first visit to one of the multibillion-dollar plants.\\nTSMC's executives found the idea so absurd that they took to calling Mr. Altman a 'podcasting bro,' one of these people said. Adding just a few more chip-making plants, much less 36, was incredibly risky because of the money involved.\\n'We are not, nor have we ever been considering multitrillion-dollar projects. While the total investment needed for the global infrastructure of A.I. to be fully built out by everyone could cost trillions over several decades, what OpenAI is specifically exploring is on the scale of hundreds of billions,' said Liz Bourgeois, an OpenAI spokeswoman.\\nAround the same time, Mr. Altman visited South Korea and held talks with two chipmakers in the country: Samsung and SK Hynix. But he soon ran into national security concerns over a prominent role for the United Arab Emirates in developing a technology that many consider critical to the economy and warfare.\\nSome White House officials and congressional leaders are afraid that approving the infrastructure to be built in the Emirates could give China a back door to important technologies. National security researchers have found evidence that some Emirati universities have worked with Chinese universities with ties to Beijing's military, said Sihao Huang, a technology fellow at the RAND Corporation.\\nTalks with the Department of Commerce, the Emirates and chipmakers are continuing. OpenAI has also expanded its discussions into other parts of the world, according to four people familiar with those talks.\\nIn the spring, company executives held meetings with Japanese officials in Tokyo. They laid out a plan for building data centers powered by electricity from nuclear power plants that were decommissioned after the Fukushima disaster in 2011.\\nDuring one meeting, a Japanese official laughed when OpenAI said it was seeking 5 gigawatts of electrical power, about a thousand times the power that an average data center consumes, a person familiar with the meeting said.\\nLater, in meetings with officials in Germany, OpenAI explored building a data center in the North Sea so it could tap into 7 gigawatts of power from offshore wind turbines, the person said.\\nBut political pressures have forced OpenAI to explore options in the United States. During a White House meeting with other tech leaders this month, Mr. Altman presented an OpenAI study called 'Infrastructure Is Destiny.'\\nThe study called for new data centers in the United States, two people familiar with the meeting said. Built at a cost of $100 billion each — about 20 times the cost of today's most powerful data centers — they would hold two million A.I. chips and consume 5 gigawatts of electricity.\\nAs he spoke, Mr. Altman sat in front of a portrait of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who poured money into massive infrastructure projects like New York's Lincoln Tunnel, two people familiar with the discussion said. The OpenAI chief told White House officials — including Commerce Secretary Gina M. Raimondo and Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser — that A.I. data centers would be a catalyst for the re-industrialization of America, creating as many as half a million jobs.\\nMr. Altman also warned that the United States risked falling behind China and that if the United States did not work with the Emirates, China would instead.\\nThis week, President Biden and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, the Emirati president, met at the White House and directed their senior officials to develop a memorandum detailing future collaboration on A.I.\\nTo bolster its efforts, OpenAI has hired Chris Lehane, a Clinton White House lawyer, as its vice president of global policy, along with two people from the Commerce Department who worked on the CHIPS Act, a bipartisan law designed to increase domestic chip manufacturing. One of them will manage future infrastructure projects and policy.\\nSpeaking last week at an investor event for T-Mobile, which is a customer of OpenAI, Mr. Altman struck a modest tone about the company's ambitions.\\n'We build on a gigantic amount of work that has come before us,' he said. 'If you think about all that had to happen throughout human history to discover semiconductors and build chips and networks and these massive data centers, we're just doing our one little bit on the very top of that.'\",\n",

       "  'summary': \"The global economy is 'turning a corner', according to the latest outlook from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development as it upgraded the UK's growth forecast for this year to faster than Japan, Italy and Germany.\\nThe OECD ranked Britain joint second among the G7 developed countries behind the US in its latest outlook on the global economy, but the UK is still expected to have the highest inflation in the group.\\nDescribing the UK's economic growth as 'robust', the OECD upgraded its growth for 2024 to 1.1% from a forecast of 0.4% made in May, as the country recovers from a mild recession at the end of last year. The forecast of 1.2% growth in 2025 was maintained.\\nIn the May forecast, the UK was behind all other nations in the informal bloc but is now expected to outpace Japan, Italy and struggling Germany. Britain is now on par with Canada and France but behind the US.\\nHowever, Britons are still expected to face headwinds from rising prices, with inflation expected to increase from 2.2% in August to 2.7% by the end of the year. UK inflation is on course to remain at 2.4% for 2025, rising at the fastest rate in the G7.\\nOverall, the OECD said that the global economy was 'turning a corner' and lower inflation and cuts to the cost of borrowing by central banks would support 'ongoing momentum' in most major economies. Those conditions will allow the global economy to return to health after the shocks caused by the coronavirus pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it said.\\nThe OECD's chief economist, Álvaro Pereira, said he was surprised by the strength of the recovery earlier in the year after the UK economy contracted in 2023.\\nThe OECD was among the most pessimistic economic forecasters when it made a judgment in May that low consumer spending and weak business investment would drag on Britain's growth.\\nBusiness investment has remained low, but rising wages and low inflation boosted consumer spending by more than expected.\\nPereira said the UK was in a similar situation to many European countries that needed to restrict debt levels.\\n'Not by introducing draconian austerity,' he said, 'but it should be said that fiscal prudence is necessary.'\\nThe Paris-based organisation reported that global trade was returning to pre-pandemic levels at a faster pace than expected after shipping firms found ways to avoid the Red Sea.\\nMeanwhile, weaker inflation meant real incomes had grown and consumer spending recovered in many countries.\\nHowever, the OECD said Asian ports were struggling to accommodate ships forced to take longer routes, pushing container costs up by 160% since last year.\\nFood prices were also stuck at much higher levels, reducing the spending power of people on low incomes.\\nSign up to Business Today\\nGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning\\nafter newsletter promotion\\nGermany was one of the worst affected by higher food prices. Europe's biggest economy had suffered a 16% increase in food prices above average wage growth since 2019 compared with a gap below 4% in Australia.\\nWorkers in Germany earn 98% of their 2019 wages, while those in Australia earn more than 100%. UK workers earn almost 102% of their 2019 average wages, despite a near 9% increase in food prices above average wages.\\nThe OECD is concerned that governments will seek to reduce spending deficits by increasing borrowing at huge cost when interest rates remain high.\\n'The bigger the debt, the bigger the amount is needed to pay interest bills,' he said. 'This will mean there is less money to spend on health, education and things like promoting growth,' he added.\\nThe chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said: 'Faster economic growth figures are welcomed, but I know there is more to do and that is why economic growth is the number one mission of this government.\\n'Next month's budget will be about fixing the foundations, so we can deliver on the promise of change and rebuild Britain.'\\nAndrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, said this week that he expected interest rates to be reduced 'gradually' as inflation eased.\",\n",

       "  'excerpt': 'The Americans have not lost a Presidents Cup in 26 years but the International Team can setup Royal Montreal to its advantage.',\n",
       "  'summary': \"Golf has always been an analytical and strategic game. Plotting one's way around a course requires a heightened understanding both of the venue itself and of one's game. But that is especially true at a team golf event, and over the years, the integration of statistics and modeling in the weeks and months leading up to those competitions has become more and more prevalent. Captains work with teams of statisticians to optimize player picks and pairings. The 'home' team does the same, with the additional responsibility of setting up the golf course to their players' advantage. Now more than ever, this type of preparation is pivotal to team golf, and remains true this week at the Presidents Cup.\\nAdvertisement\\nThe 14th playing of the biennial team competition — which is held opposite to Ryder Cup years — kicks off Thursday at Royal Montreal's Blue Course. The International Team has won the event just once, in 1998, and there has been one tie, in 2003. Since then the U.S. has dominated the series, most recently winning by five points at Quail Hollow in 2022.\\nBut could this year be more competitive than years past? Which players are more likely to find success on which parts of the golf course? Like any PGA Tour venue, Royal Montreal's 7,279-yard par-70 setup favors some skill sets more than others. Both the U.S. team and the International Team have been studying and breaking down the routing, prepping for a week of four-ball, foursomes and singles matches.\\nAfter conducting our own research, here's what we think they've deduced. Royal Montreal is a tight, tree-lined and classic-looking golf course that will accommodate players who are strong in the following areas: driving accuracy, 100-150-yard approach shots and proximity to the hole. All stats are via DataGolf.com.\\nAt Royal Montreal, accuracy off the tee will be heavily favored over driving distance due to the course's narrow fairways and thick rough, which will be particularly penal this year at about 3 inches in height. Most PGA Tour venues naturally give an advantage to the longest hitters (because it's always advantageous to be closer to the hole), but Royal Montreal has proven to be an exception to that trend. At the 2014 RBC Canadian Open — the last PGA Tour-sanctioned event to be held at the course — the winner, Tim Clark, ranked first in driving accuracy and 71st in driving distance. Of the next top 10 players on the leaderboard, seven were ranked within the top 15 in driving accuracy, and only three were ranked top 15 in the distance.\\nAdvertisement\\nAt Royal Montreal, the players who typically hit more fairways will have a clear advantage: The fairways are narrow, but they're not impossible to hold in the way Winged Foot was, for example. Accurate drivers of the ball will have a statistical sweet spot, where playing from the fairway more often and more reliably will set them up for success.\\nThis course fit attribute likely explains captain Jim Furyk's selection of Brian Harman. He was a controversial addition on this year's U.S squad, as the form that helped him with the 2023 Open Championship hasn't necessarily carried into this year. Despite being ranked 10th in the Presidents Cup standings, Harman has just three top-10 finishes in 2024 and one in his last six starts. But Harman is one of the straightest drivers in the world. He ranked No. 15 in driving accuracy, per Data Golf. The U.S. team also has the No. 3 and 4 most accurate drivers in the world in Collin Morikawa and Russell Henley, the latter another one of Furyk's captain's picks. Scottie Scheffler is one spot behind Harman at No. 16. The International Team has just two players ranked in the top 30 on that list: Si Woo Kim at No. 20 and Tom Kim at No. 28. Captain's pick Min Woo Lee, for example, ranks No. 274 in driving accuracy while being the second-longest player in the entire field. It'll be fascinating to see if they pair long and inaccurate players like Lee or Byeong-Hun An with more accurate drivers like the Kims.\\nOn the other side of the spectrum, however, the other four American captain's picks — Tony Finau, Sam Burns, Keegan Bradley and Max Homa — are all ranked outside the top 100 in accuracy, with Homa being the worst at No. 264.\\nOne key aspect to follow as pairings come out: All four par 3s are on odd-numbered holes and both par 5s are even. That could allow captains to hide poor drivers during alternate shot. For example, Max Homa and Wyndham Clark have been wild off the tee but remain pretty good ball strikers. Does Furyk keep them away from fourball and use them on odd numbers in foursomes?\\nIf mid-to-long irons were the sneaky key to Europe's convincing win at the 2023 Ryder Cup in Rome, there's a good chance short irons and wedges are the most important approach shots this year in Montreal. Most holes at Royal Montreal will leave players around 120 to 140 yards from the pin, especially with so many dog legs around water hazards making driver a risky decision. Even the shorter holes often require 4 irons off the tee, keeping that range in play often. If we once again use the 2014 Canadian Open as a helpful tool, four of the top seven finishers ranked top 20 that season in greens in regulation from 125-to-150 yards.\\nAdvertisement\\nThis is made even more interesting by comments Rory McIlroy made leading into Rome on the Subpar podcast about the course setup. 'If you break it down in terms of the parts of the game, we want to get wedges and short irons out of the Americans' hands,' McIlroy said. 'We know that that's what they're really good at.'\\nSo does that set up for a clear American advantage? Yes, but maybe not as much as you'd assume. The Americans do indeed have three of the five best approach players from 100-150 yards over the last two years, per DataGolf. Scottie Scheffler (No. 2), Russell Henley (No. 4) and Collin Morikawa (No. 5) all averaged more than 0.065 strokes gained in that range. Henley wasn't the sexiest of captain's picks but he thrives in both of these first two metrics.\\nGO DEEPER\\nPresidents Cup analysis: 10 notes to know on U.S. vs. International\\nThe Internationals have plenty of top players here too, though. Tom Kim ranks No. 7, while Hideki Matsuyama and captain's picks Corey Conners and Cristiaan Bezuidenhout all rank in the top 20. The U.S. certainly has the overall advantage as they round out a roster of players like Patrick Cantlay, Brian Harman, Sam Burns and Sahith Theegala all rating higher than the next-best international (Byeong Hun An), but it's an area both teams are solid in.\\nThe most notable U.S. team omission, Justin Thomas, ranks No. 6 in this category.\\nBear with us: Hitting the ball closer to the hole is important this week.\\nThat's true anywhere, but this is not a course where you simply need to find greens and be careful. This isn't Riviera, where short game and finding greens are everything because any missed green leaves a brutal recovery. The Royal Montreal greens are tiered with back-to-front slopes, with Cantlay saying it's necessary to find the right spots, but overall it isn't too penal for misses around the greens. There's less value in being able to find greens as there is in putting it close. Ipso facto, you're allowed to get aggressive.\\nWhile the PGA Tour proximity to the hole stat isn't necessarily perfect, as it could be more about being consistently average as opposed to what we're looking for, it's no surprise the world's best ball-striker Scheffler ranks No. 2 in average proximity. The PGA Tour doesn't explicitly track who hits the most shots within certain distances, but the great Justin Ray did some digging and found the tour average for approach shots inside 10 feet is 12.6 percent. The best on tour is Scheffler at 15.7 percent. The only other Presidents Cup participant at the top is Sam Burns, ranking fourth at 15.1 percent, making his captain's pick feel more valuable as somebody who might not be consistent but can get aggressive.\\nAdvertisement\\nMaybe an unscientific way of thinking about it is players who are skilled at getting 'hot' and going on birdie streaks. Scheffler, Morikawa, Burns and Theegala are some of the best at going on heaters. Schauffele is also somebody who is known for playing paint-by-numbers golf, but in reality he's one of the best in the world at hitting the shot he needs to hit. When he decided he needed to attack on Sunday at Valhalla, he went on a run of three birdies in four holes with dialed-in iron shots to win his first major. On the international side, Matsuyama is one of the streakiest players in the game, highlighted by his Sunday 62 to win the Genesis or consecutive 64s to win in Memphis.\\nYes, the United States are heavily favored for a reason. DataGolf gives the U.S. a 64.7 percent chance of winning, but team match play is not simply who is better across four days of stroke play. It's who is better in the right moments, who is better in the right areas and who manages the strategy of cup golf better.\\nAll in all, the top Americans to watch are some of the obvious. Scheffler is indeed the No. 1 player in the world and should play well, but one who fits Royal Montreal better than maybe anyone is Morikawa. His accurate driving and excellent iron game are a perfect fit. Outside of the obvious picks, Henley is an uber-reliable player who thrives in all the ways you want. Burns, meanwhile, offers an aggressive birdie machine with a good putter. Many — including some on the International Team — expect the U.S. to pair Burns with his best friend Scheffler again. If so, we'll see if they're able to improve on their winless record in four cup starts together.\\nMatsuyama is clearly the Internationals' ace. He's returned to form as a top-5-to-10 player in the world, and how International captain Mike Weir uses him will be crucial to their chances. Also watch for Tom Kim, Si Woo Kim and Sungjae Im as three Koreans well suited to the test Royal Montreal offers. All three are on the shorter side in driver distance while being accurate and have elite iron play. Considering putting tends to be less of an indicator here, that also helps Si Woo Kim.\\nThe International side is desperate to win their first Presidents Cup in 26 years, and the Americans want a win after a crushing Ryder Cup 12 months ago. Montreal is set to be a fantastic stage, and now you know what to watch for.\\n(Illustration: Meech Robinson / The Athletic: Photos: Harry How, Minas Panagiotakis / Getty Images; Keyur Khamar, Chris Condon / PGA Tour)\",\n",

       "  'excerpt': \"Scheduling of event before budget at end of October comes under fire at party conference as 'wrong way round'\",\n",
       "  'summary': \"Business leaders have warned that the government's plans for a major global investment summit are in danger of falling flat, amid growing frustrations over high attendance costs and its timing two weeks before the budget.\\nAs a central plank in Labour's proposals to drive up investment in Britain, the party pledged in the general election campaign to host the summit within the first 100 days of winning power to show that the UK would be 'open for business' under a new government.\\nThe event was confirmed last month by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, and the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, for 14 October as a flagship opportunity for up to 300 senior business figures hosted by the prime minister.\\nHowever, several business leaders at Labour's annual conference in Liverpool this week said it was at risk of failing to live up to its high-profile billing, because it would take place while ministers were still thrashing out the details of several major economic decisions before the 30 October budget.\\n'It's the wrong way round,' said Stephen Phipson, the chief executive of Make UK, which represents 20,000 manufacturing firms across the country. 'There is a concern about the timing, coming two weeks before the budget.\\n'People will want to know what the government's priorities are before committing investment.'\\nOne industry source said the government had only started to approach companies within the past two weeks about the event, expected to take place at a central London location – a hurried timescale for a major summit – with proposals to charge up to £250,000 for attendance.\\nWhile questions remained over several key economic priorities, they said the investment summit, as it was described to them by officials, could amount to spending 'hundreds of thousands of pounds for a photo opportunity' with Keir Starmer or King Charles.\\nAnother said company chairs and chief executives were unlikely to attend, with several large firms planning to send more junior representatives – including several large Wall Street banks.\\nGovernment sources insisted they were having no problems in attracting senior figures. Reynolds told bosses on Monday he was struggling to manage overwhelming demand, comparing it to 'planning a wedding list'.\\nLast week it emerged Larry Fink, the chief executive and chair of BlackRock, was being lined up to attend, according to Sky News, as the party battled suggestions that it would struggle to attract the 300 industry leaders it had pledged.\\nSpeaking at Labour's £3,000-a-head 'business day', taking place alongside its main conference, Reynolds said: 'The problem is not getting people to come, it's managing the interest. It's like planning a wedding.'\\nIt is understood some ministers have privately questioned the summit's timing, because companies were still awaiting clarity on tax and spending priorities due in the budget. Business surveys this week show uncertainty over the budget is weighing on Britain's economy, amid criticism that Reeves' warning of the need for 'tough' decisions was hitting confidence.\\nHowever, it is thought it would be too late to change course, having promised the summit would form a key role in the government's first 100 days. The City minister, Tulip Siddiq, said at a fringe event that the timing was in part due to the impact of the snap election on government schedules.\\nLabour sources also confirmed the government would not be ready to announce its industrial strategy ahead of the summit – a policy which business chiefs have said will be important for steering investment in the economy.\\nIt is understood a green paper will be published alongside the budget to consult on its plans, before a full launch of the final plan early next year.\\nA chair of the industrial strategy council, which is expected to oversee the policy, has yet to be appointed, amid reports that ITV chief executive Carolyn McCall had snubbed the opportunity. The government is also yet to appoint an investment minister to coordinate business decisions with government.\\nMake UK's Phipson said companies needed clarity. 'Key appointments remain unannounced,' he said. 'For business to feel truly secure to make those longer term investments, meat on the bones of the industrial strategy must be a priority which comes at speed.'\\nJonny Haseldine, policy manager at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the summit would still send an 'important signal' that the UK was open for business, and that bosses could take the lead from Labour's outline commitments on tax.\\n'The direction of travel from government is encouraging. But businesses, both in the UK and overseas, will be keen to see more detail on competitive planning and tax policies, in order to achieve much needed growth,' he said.\\nChris Hayward, policy chair of the City of London Corporation, said the summit would be a key event to sell Britain to the world. However, he cautioned that ahead of the budget, a long-term global tax regime was required.\\n'Tax is an important part of the equation: it's no good being in sell mode then around the world people say: 'Your tax rates are too high.' The government cannot resolve that immediately but it can set out a pathway, a course of action that will get us to a globally competitive position on business taxes.'\\nA Labour spokesperson said: 'This government has hit the ground running, delivering the change the business leaders were crying out for including major planning reforms, action on late payments and setting up GB Energy. The urgent work of turning around our economy has begun and there is no time to waste on attracting investment to Britain, that is why we have committed to holding this summit in the first 100 days.\\n'We are on track to deliver an ambitious programme bringing together hundreds of attendees representing the best of business from across the globe.'\",\n",

       "  'summary': \"Australian supermarkets have faced growing scrutiny over grocery prices since the pandemic amid the ongoing cost-of-living crisis.\\nOn Monday, Coles and Woolworths were accused of inflating prices for a short period before placing them in 'Prices Dropped' or 'Down Down' promotions. Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) chair, Gina Cass-Gottlieb, branded such savings 'illusory'.\\nThe executive at the Consumer Federation of Australia and deputy CEO at the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network (ACCAN), Gareth Downing, said a range of such retailer tactics make it difficult for shoppers to accurately and concisely compare prices.\\nHere are some others:\\nDowning pointed to the example of a 'seasonal discount' on items whose pricing remains the same year-round. He said the practice often affects durable products, such as a drying rack or barbecue equipment, creating the sense that it is a limited time offer, when it is not an offer at all.\\nBy law, unit prices must be displayed accurately, clearly and close to the item price. But their display was often non-compliant, Downing said.\\n'It's very hard to compare milk with other milk if you have a discount sticker over the top of the label and the unit price is in a size four font,' he said.\\nSign up for Guardian Australia's breaking news email\\nThe 'very harmful' practice affects both consumer pockets and the ability to foster vigorous pricing competition, he said.\\nIn March, the Consumer Action Law Centre told a Senate inquiry into supermarket prices that supermarket food prices must be fair and transparent – and should not use their power and size to manipulate prices.\\nIf you've wondered why your box of cereal isn't going as far as it once did, you're not imagining it. Many products are getting smaller and more expensive, including Kellogg's Crunchy Nut, Sultana Bran and Froot Loops.\\nBy subtly reducing the size of a box of cereal while increasing its price, food manufacturers and supermarkets – which ultimately set prices – have resulted in price hikes of up to 82.1% for consumers.\\nRegular staples such as milk, bread and eggs are generally split up and positioned at the back of supermarkets. Shoppers then have to travel past other items to reach their target products, researchers told consumer watchdog Choice – eventually leaving with more than they intended to buy.\\nImpulse purchases – usually junk foods – line checkout queues. It's a psychological tactic that leaves shoppers 'guilt-free' to opt for higher-cost 'treats' after picking up fruit, vegetables and staples, according to the watchdog.\\nSupermarkets are adjusting to the speedy shopper, grouping products together to help solve a problem, Choice has reported.\\nAmong products suggested for a Mexican dinner, in one example given, is usually a premium product with a large margin. The shopper saves time, but spends more than they otherwise might have.\\nBrands pay for prime position at aisle ends, known as 'end caps'. There, shoppers, who generally skirt the supermarket rather than venture down every aisle, are targeted by their displays, experts told Choice.\\nEncouraging customers to save money by buying several of one item when they only need one – or none at all – is an enduring tactic. These 'deals' have long been criticised by consumer groups for not saving shoppers money, or costing more.\\nAt Sydney-based Harris Farm Markets, signage has been used on punnets of blueberries, for example, implying buying several of the same item (advertised as 2 for $6) offers better value. Small print below – $3 each – shows this not to be the case.\\nSign up to Afternoon Update\\nOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters\\nafter newsletter promotion\\nChoice has kept a close watch on the rise of phantom labels: home brand products that are not immediately obvious as such. Phantom labels often cost less but result in retail companies squeezing out smaller brands.\\nThe tactic was perfected by Aldi, where the vast majority of products are own brand but are not generic or labelled Aldi. Coles, Woolworths, IGA and Foodworks have followed suit, with brands such as Koi, Cub, Thomas Dux, Community Co, Hillview, Smitten, Shine and Woofin' Good all cited as examples of generic supermarket lines with polished new images.\\nSupermarkets use price tags on normally priced products that are designed to mimic specials tags. On closer inspection, said Choice, the products do not appear to be discounted at all. This and the next four tactics are part of the watchdog's spotlight on 'dodgy' and 'shonky' promotions.\\nChoice has also drawn attention to the omission of contextual information that helps a customer determine how special a 'special' price is. A supermarket can label peaches at $3.90/kg as 'special' – but the customer has nothing to compare the price with.\\nChoice made a complaint to regulators after Coles customers were told that low prices of some products were locked in until a certain date, only for the price to rise before that date. Coles apologised and refunded customers.\\nSupermarkets have used labels to advertise prices that have fallen, in one case comparing the current price with a higher price than that seven years ago.\\n'Because supermarkets don't publish historical pricing information, it's impossible for people to know if the price was actually cheaper a week ago', Choice said in its online petition calling for more price transparency.\\nGreen means fresh – and red and yellow signal a bargain, retail experts have told Choice. It's no surprise, then, that Chemist Warehouse – which promotes itself as a destination for cheap toiletries and medicines – is a sea of red and yellow, while Coles' 'Down Down' deals are also emblazoned with red and yellow.\\nSpecial prices – but only for those who have handed over their personal details as part of a loyalty scheme.\\nCountdown clocks, falsely warning shoppers the price would rise if they did not quickly make the purchase, are part of what is known as 'manipulative design' or digital 'dark patterns'.\\nThe online tactic, used to create a sense of urgency, has been highlighted by the Consumer Policy Research Centre.\\nThe thinktank has claimed that unfair business practises are allowed to thrive because of gaps in Australian trading law.\\nDo you know more?

Joe Biden will make one of the final big speeches of his presidency at 10am ET today, when he addresses the UN general assembly in New York. The annual gathering of world leaders is a significant moment for any president, but even more so for Biden, because he's due to depart the White House in January. His administration has not given many hints of what he might say, but in his speech, you can expect him to make the case for his handling of everything from climate change to Israel's invasion of Gaza, and potentially the escalating crisis in Lebanon.\\nDonald Trump, meanwhile, will be in Savannah, Georgia, to give a speech at 1pm billed as discussing his policy on taxation and manufacturing. The ex-president's economic proposals have centered on a combination of tariffs and tax cuts that he argues would lower prices for consumer, after several years of high inflation under Biden. Economists aren't so sure, and chances are Trump veers away from the subject anyway – he's known to go off topic throughout his speeches. We'll be keeping an eye on what both men have to say.\\nHere's what else is going on: Antony Blinken may soon become the latest Biden administration official to be held in contempt. The Republican-led House foreign affairs committee has demanded he testify today, but he has reportedly told them he is busy with the UN general assembly, and when the committee meets beginning at 10.15am, they may vote to sanction him.\\nA scandal brews in New York City's suburbs. The New York Times reported yesterday that freshman Republican congressman Anthony D'Esposito gave part-time jobs to both his lover and his fiancee's daughter, which may be a violation of House ethics rules.\\nA vote in the House on a short-term funding measure to prevent a government shutdown is expected on Wednesday.

       "  'summary': \"Covering an NHL training camp usually isn't about focusing on one big story.\\nThere's time for that as the season rolls along. The reality of life, hockey and wins and losses at the NHL level tends to focus the attention of a hockey market more narrowly over time.\\nThe reality of camp, however, is different and more general. There are as many as 60 players on the ice at an NHL training camp, and a dizzying number of roster battles, drills and small details to pick up on.\\nSome of those small details, noticeable only to attentive observers, will come to shape a team's fortunes over the ensuing year, while others will turn out to be inconsequential going forward.\\nHaving ruminated on what we saw up in Penticton over the past week, here are five takeaways we think our readers should know from Vancouver Canucks training camp going into the preseason. 1. Buying high on the Canucks' rush potential\\nIt's clear that the Canucks, in analyzing their performance last season, have identified attacking off the rush as an essential way to improve going forward.\\nThis is the correct diagnosis. Vancouver ran extraordinarily pure from a scoring chance conversion perspective throughout last season, especially before the All-Star break, but generated five-on-five shots and rush chances like a clear non-playoff team. As talented as Vancouver's core group is, once this club's preposterous scoring efficiency came back to Earth last season, their team-level inability to consistently generate scoring chances at even strength became a genuine weakness, one that ultimately proved fatal to their ambitions in the second round of the playoffs.\\nIt's evident that the Canucks have thoughtfully approached making sure this year's team is more consistently dangerous off of the rush. And there's evidence of a holistic approach in diagnosing the issue, targeting the personnel who can help in this specific area — adding Jake DeBrusk, Danton Heinen, Kiefer Sherwood and Daniel Sprong in free agency — and then making systematic adjustments in how the Canucks play to take advantage of what their new wingers can add to the club's north-south attacking threat.\\nTraining camp was unusually focused on breakout drills and transition work. One drill especially caught our eye, given the breakout 'landmarks' Canucks head coach Rick Tocchet referenced throughout camp, in which the weak side winger slashes off of the wall and into the middle of the ice along the offensive blue line while the defender starts the breakout. Meanwhile, the centre moves to the weak side wall, and the strong side winger skates at full tilt into the zone.\\nThis breakout creates the option for a deflection into the zone or a skilled play from the weak-side winger who can attempt to send in one of their slashing teammates behind the defence out wide with a deft touch.\\nThis breakout we saw on Day 2 of camp accomplishes a couple of really interesting things for Vancouver. First off, it's a look that allows the team to attack at a remarkable pace through the neutral zone, which is key. Second, however, even if the Canucks can't regularly pull off the home run play on this breakout, the median outcome from it still takes advantage of the team's strengths.\\nVancouver has been an exceptional forechecking team over the past few years, and a variety of their key personnel — from J.T. Miller and Elias Pettersson through to Dakota Joshua, Pius Suter, Nils Höglander and Conor Garland — excel at being disruptive forces as the first forward into the zone (the F1). If the weak-side winger can make a skilled play or weight a deflection so that their linemates get the puck at full pace and can challenge a defender out wide one-on-one, great. If the weak-side winger is simply able to deflect the puck into the zone, then the structure of the breakout serves to put Vancouver's disruptive centremen into position to be the F1, as opposed to the F3, which takes advantage of what Pettersson, Suter and Miller can accomplish as forecheckers — while moving at incredible pace as the opposition defender attempts a retrieval.\\n'It's a weird drill because you're (cutting in), you're looking back, the puck could bounce weird,' said DeBrusk. 'But it's about the thought process, not really about the reps being super clean. … As forwards, we're going and we're going to certain spots. Anytime you know where you should be going on the ice, it gives you a better chance. Even if there's a breakdown, it's organized.'\\nThat's the point, structurally. Theoretically, either way, it should work.\\nWe saw from the Tocchet, Patrik Allvin and Jim Rutherford troika last season how the club was able to thoughtfully approach taking a quantum leap forward as a defensive team: Get big defenders, get forwards with pace who can backcheck, manage the puck conservatively in the offensive zone and get cult-like buy-in, and one of the league's most permissive units became one of its stingiest year over year. It was a remarkable turnaround.\\nWe're not necessarily predicting the Canucks will have the same level of worst-to-first success upgrading as a rush-attacking team this season, but watching the team work on rush drills during camp, it certainly had the explicit look and feel of a plan coming together.\\n'Wanting to play faster, wanting to use my speed, that's something they said they liked about me,' DeBrusk said, recalling the conversations he had with management during the summer. 'They wanted to play a transition game and they thought I could fit into that.' 2. It's going to be hard for forwards to crack this roster\\nWe spend a lot of time during camp and the preseason talking about roster battles, but in truth, in the NHL's hard cap era, most rosters are 90-95 percent set before the puck drops at training camp.\\nOpportunity is scant, and when it arrives, it's more likely to arrive in-season or as a result of injury, as opposed to because a certain player won a roster spot outright at camp — although that does happen.\\nThere are definitely jobs available in this Canucks lineup, but the competition is more about minutes and roles, as opposed to being about roster spots. That competition will largely play out between a variety of players — guys like Heinen, Sherwood and Höglander — who are clearly bound for the NHL roster.\\nLet's illustrate this directly. Here's how we're projecting Vancouver's forward lines, for now, with what we feel very confident about filled out directly and the jobs that are still a matter of internal competition marked with an 'X' as unknown.\\nSo that's five jobs for wingers available until Joshua returns to the lineup. And here are those contenders, which we've tiered below.\\nThe tiers reflect the following criteria: In the top tier are the obvious NHL players on contracts who can't be fully buried in the American League. At the very least they'll fill out the fourth-line wing spots. We put Jonathan Lekkerimäki in his own tier given he's never played an NHL game and is on an entry-level contract. We also put Daniel Sprong in his own tier because the club values the right-handed shooting and power-play utility enough that they chased him in free agency, but at his annual average value, nothing is guaranteed. The next group consists of depth wingers the Canucks utilized when the chips were down in the playoffs last season. And the next tier includes Sammy Blais, who is on a PTO, and Arshdeep Bains, who the club didn't turn to in the playoffs last season.\\nWhen you really diagram it, there's minimal opportunity available for the Lekkerimäki, Linus Karlsson, Bains and even Phillip Di Giuseppe tier of winger this preseason. Maybe there's one open job available on the NHL roster, and even that opportunity may only exist short term as a result of Joshua's indefinite absence. 3. That said, Lekkerimäki enters the preseason with a shot\\nRight off the bat, Lekkerimäki can attack off the rush at a professional level. We know the club has prioritized improving in that area more than any other this offseason. That would seem to create some favourable headwinds for the 20-year-old rookie, especially given his play off the puck looked more advanced than we expected throughout camp.\\nCertainly, Lekkerimäki turned the heads of his teammates and linemates in Penticton.\\n'He's ahead of where I was when I broke into the league, in terms of making plays,' DeBrusk said of Lekkerimäki. 'I was more simple at his age, I was scared to make a play. I'd just get downhill and get to the net. I was playing with David Krejci, I was more so trying to drive it. Give it to Krejci at all costs, kick out and go to the net and fly. He sees the game really well, and you learn as you play, but he's ahead of where I was at that age.'\\nLekkerimäki will still have work to do in preseason action to earn a look when the regular season begins, but we should elevate how realistically we're viewing the possibility of him being a Game 1 option for Tocchet. It's still early, but it seems like it's trending toward being a serious consideration. 4. Why the Kevin Lankinen addition should be a huge relief for Canucks fans\\nAs impressed as we were by the upgraded speed and rush attacking focus at Canucks training camp, we were equally worried about the state of Vancouver goaltending.\\nThose concerns were allayed somewhat as the weekend rolled along, especially after Artūrs Šilovs stole the show at the scrimmage and the Canucks signed Kevin Lankinen. Still, when you consider the full picture, it does feel like the other side of the coin in comparison with how the Canucks thoughtfully approached levelling up as an attacking team this offseason.\\nWhere the upgraded rush personnel feels like a thoughtful part of a whole, the vibes in net for the Canucks couldn't be worse. The club has cast goalie coach Ian Clark's departure as a surprise, which hangs over this somewhat, especially given how Clark's star pupils have historically fared in their first seasons away from his tutelage. Then there's the uncertainty about Thatcher Demko, as he attempts to recover from an unprecedented muscular injury, which will linger even after he returns.\\nŠilovs has a lot of talent, but he's battled inconsistency in his professional career. Jiří Patera didn't look the part of a credible NHL option at camp. Nikita Tolopilo is obviously talented but hasn't had a game of NHL experience yet.\\nWhen you consider the whole picture, adding a veteran like Lankinen, with a real NHL body of work as an average goalie, feels like a huge relief. Even if we buy Tocchet's argument that the Canucks will be able to fall back on their sturdy defensive form to insulate whoever is in net, and we should, adding Lankinen is a key steadying move. It should help the Canucks avoid any worst-case scenarios. 5. What if Kirill Kudryavtsev is NHL-ready?\\nVancouver's 2022 seventh-round pick Kirill Kudryavtsev turned heads at Young Stars and during training camp.\\nThe young Russian-born defender even earned a promotion during camp, the only significant lineup change the Canucks made to either of their NHL-level groups, and was elevated to play alongside Tyler Myers.\\nThough Kudryavtsev didn't shine in the scrimmage necessarily, there's a lot about his game — the puck-moving ability, the versatility to fill in on the right side, the lack of panic, the weight on his passes — that looks NHL level, or thereabouts, right now.\\nNow, obviously that's an exciting prospect for the Canucks. Teams are always in need of credible options on the back end, and Kudryavtsev might be one in the short term. It's important to distinguish, however, between a player who's ready early and a player with significant NHL upside.\\nSometimes players, especially somewhat undersized left-handed defenders like Michael Del Zotto or Victor Mete in the past, are capable of making an instantaneous NHL impact upon leaving the major junior ranks. And ultimately those players are still more likely to top out as NHL-level depth options throughout their career, as opposed to top-four horses NHL teams can count on to log major minutes on a winning team.\\nIf Kudryavtsev plays NHL games for the Canucks this season, or even pushes to make the team out of camp (although that seems far less likely), that would be an incredible development for Vancouver. It would give the club a ton of options, and also a valuable out-of-nowhere trade asset to consider spending on higher-leverage upgrades.\\nAs I considered Kudryavtsev's progress and readiness this week, the crucial distinction between a prospect's arrival date and their probable upside stuck in my mind. It's something to keep in mind if Kudryavtsev can stick around as the roster reductions accelerate once we get into the NHL preseason.\\n(Photo of Brock Boeser, Elias Pettersson and Nils Höglander: Harry How / Getty Images)\",\n",

       "  'summary': \"Mobilizing workers at a Trader Joe's store on New York's Lower East Side marginally lost a union election last year. They may ultimately get their union after all.\\nThe general counsel of the US's top labor watchdog is seeking an order demanding that Trader Joe's recognize and bargain with the union, Trader Joe's United, amid allegations that employees were threatened and disparaged from unionizing.\\nUnder a framework introduced by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) last year, employers can be ordered to bargain with a union if they commit unfair labor practices that would set aside the results of a union ballot.\\nThe new framework, designed to ensure a 'timely and fair' process of seeking union representation, was drawn up as the NLRB found the construction materials firm Cemex had engaged in more than 20 instances of objectionable or unlawful misconduct during a campaign.\\nIf an employer commits an unfair labor practice during a union election which requires throwing out the result, under the Cemex framework – rather than re-run the election – the NLRB can order the employer to recognize and bargain with the union.\\nTrader Joe's is one of the largest grocery chains in the US, with hundreds of stores and tens of thousands of employees nationwide. Facing a slew of allegations around its handling of unionizing efforts, the retailer has claimed the NLRB is unconstitutional, filing legal papers challenging the federal agency alongside firms including Elon Musk's SpaceX, Amazon and Starbucks.\\nWorkers who tried to unionize at its store on the Lower East Side of New York lost the election in a 76-76 tied vote in April 2023. But Trader Joe's United became the first union to file a request for a bargaining order under the new Cemex framework.\\nLast week, the NLRB's general counsel issued a complaint consolidating charges filed by workers against Trader Joe's, and is seeking a bargaining order.\\n'As part of the remedy for the unfair labor practices alleged above, the General Counsel seeks an order requiring respondent to recognize and bargain with the union,' reads the complaint, issued on 17 September.\\nTrader Joe's 'has really thrown a lot into fighting our union', Bridget Arend, an organizer who has worked for five years at the Essex store in New York. 'They wouldn't do that if we didn't have quite a lot to gain from it.'\\nWorkers pushed to unionize in response to issues they experienced through the Covid-19 pandemic, safety problems and having benefits scaled back over the years, according to Arend, who claimed broad support during early efforts to organize. 'To see how the corporation so harshly stamped that out was really heartbreaking,' she said.\\nTrader Joe's workers at the store 'know kind of the extent of the illegal union busting that's happened', Arend claimed. 'We've experienced it firsthand. But to see it actually being dealt with is really exciting.'\\nTrader Joe's declined to comment on the consolidated complaint, or the request for a Cemex bargaining order. The company has until 1 October to respond. An administrative law judge hearing is scheduled to rule on the complaint in January.\\nSarah Beth Ryther, vice-president of Trader Joe's United and a worker at a unionized store in Minneapolis, said: 'This is a company that has proven time and again that they are unafraid of using really coercive tactics in order to stop workers from exercising their rights.\\n'We've built over the past two years a really strong network of organizers at organized and unorganized stores and that advocacy is slow, but we're trying through bargaining trying to put as much pressure on the company as possible.'\",\n",

The government said that all consignments that had been held up and tested were found to have traces of the pest and these robust checks had stopped them from entering the country.\\nHowever, affected suppliers have been highly critical of the lack of communication as to why the goods were being held, with the HTA saying the lack of clear information was 'completely unacceptable'.\\nVincenzo Marini, the chief executive of haulage company Marini, which sends 15 lorries a week to Britain, told the Guardian that one of his drivers was forced to stay in Kent, near Sevington, for six days after his company received no information on why their load had been held and when it would be released.\\nSpeaking last week, he said: 'The lorry has now been blocked for eight days and today I had to switch drivers – the first one was sleeping in the lorry all this time.\\n'How could I leave him there without any information on how long this would take? We are kept in the dark about everything.'\\nMarini, who has been sending good since the 1980s, added: 'The UK is putting me into huge difficulties. I know other companies that have lost drivers, too, and so they have abandoned the UK due to this mess.'\\nAnother affected Italian supplier, which preferred not be named, said it had now paused deliveries to the UK over concerns that similar holdups would take place, leaving a number of UK customers waiting for deliveries.\\nSign up to First Edition\\nOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters\\nafter newsletter promotion\\nThe company, which relies on the UK for 60% of its business, said there had been no communication about what had happened and many of the support lines were engaged when they tried to contact support agencies.\\nA spokesperson for the company said: 'Since the checks, transport costs have gone up a lot because lorries are now having to often wait five or six hours for these checks and you have to put the prices up.\\n'The drivers don't want to go because they are getting sick and tired of waiting.'\\nThis is the latest in a line of holdups at the border, with lorries being held for more than a day earlier in the year after IT outages led to long delays of perishable goods coming into the country.\\nTransport en Logistiek Nederland, which represents 5,000 Dutch transport companies, told the Guardian earlier this year that some of its members could start rejecting jobs because of the new delays at the border, with the average driver being held for more than four hours.\\nIn its letter, the HTA called for border agencies to improve communication with their service users more clearly, and called for an urgent roundtable with ministers to discuss its concerns.\\nA government spokesperson said: 'We are committed to reducing barriers to trade and cutting red tape by striking a fair balance between business and biosecurity.\\n'Physical checks play an important role in helping stop harmful plant and animal diseases reaching our shores, as can be seen from detecting non-native plant pests found in these consignments'.\",\n",

It is run by Anthony Bamford, a Conservative peer who took over the business from his father.\\nBamford is among the biggest and most influential Conservative party donors, and has in the past provided money, takeaway meals and a wedding venue to former prime minister Boris Johnson.\\nGlobal construction and agricultural equipment sales fell by 4.3% in 2023, according to JCB's figures, or by 7% according to Off-Highway Research, a consultancy that has also forecast declining sales in 2024.\\nThe JCB chief executive, Graeme Macdonald, said sales had been strong in North America and India, where it operates several factories. US infrastructure companies have benefited from increased investment from Joe Biden's administration. However, faltering activity in the British construction sector and a near-recession in Germany threatened to drag on profits this year.\\nHe said: 'The full year market outlook for 2024 is less positive, with challenging conditions in the UK and Europe, particularly in Germany where economic activity has declined sharply during 2024. In the UK, housebuilding activity has contracted, which is having a negative impact on machine utilisation.'\\nThe British company's increased profits and sales in 2023 came despite its decision to halt sales to Russia, because of Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. The Guardian revealed in May that the company had continued to build and supply equipment for the Russian market months after saying it had stopped exports.

JCB is betting that hydrogen will allow it to continue to make combustion engines, which it argues work better for off-road applications such as its diggers which mostly operate on diesel fossil fuel. The combustion of hydrogen mainly produces water, although it can also produce other pollutants.\\nBamford's son, Jo Bamford, runs a business that hopes to operate hydrogen distribution.

Cost-cutting measures, including job cuts, were announced two weeks ago, and the company is also looking for new investment.\\nEurope's electric vehicle sector has been struggling as consumer demand for greener vehicles struggles to increase quickly enough. Last week, industry figures showed the number of cars sold in the EU fell to 643,000 in August.\\n'While overall momentum for electrification remains strong, we need to make sure that we take the right actions at the right time in response to headwinds in the automotive market, and wider industrial climate.

       "  'summary': \"Britain's biggest building society is to let first-time buyers borrow up to six times their earnings in what has been labelled a 'gamechanging' move that ramps up the mortgage price war.\\nWeeks after it was announced that the Halifax and Lloyds would allow new buyers to take out loans worth up to 5.5 times their household annual income, Nationwide said it would now go up to six times income – a first for a major high street lender.\\nNationwide is also cutting its mortgage rates and increasing its maximum loan sizes, so that someone taking out a home loan for more than 90% of the property's value will now be able to borrow up to £750,000 – up from the existing £500,000, and higher than the £570,000 limit at many rivals.\\nThe moves come amid a mortgage price war that has led to lenders jostling to cut their rates after the Bank of England's 1 August interest rate cut and the expectation of more reductions to come.\\nIn July, new fixed deals priced at below 4% went back on sale for the first time since February, and Nationwide's changes include a range of fresh rate cuts that mean it will be the first major lender 'for a long time' to offer a fixed deal priced at below 5% to first-time buyers borrowing 95% – that is, those who can only afford to put down a 5% deposit.\\nHowever, probably Nationwide's most eye-catching move is its decision to increase the maximum sums it is willing to offer borrowers.\\nTraditionally the typical maximum for how much someone could borrow was 4.5 times their annual income, but in recent years a growing number of lenders have been offering higher income multiples. On 29 August, Lloyds Banking Group said its Lloyds and Halifax brands would now allow new buyers to take out loans worth up to 5.5 times their household annual income – up from 4.49 times. Several other leading lenders also go up to 5.5 times.\\nHowever, not many mortgage providers go up to six times income or more: one that does is Perenna, while in 2021, another lender, Habito, said it would let some homebuyers borrow up to seven times their income.\\nNationwide previously increased its maximum income multiples in April 2021, when it lifted the figure to 5.5 times earnings for certain first-time buyers as part of an initiative called Helping Hand.\\nIt said that from Tuesday it would give new buyers the option of borrowing up to six times their income when taking out a five- or 10-year fixed rate for up to 95% of the property's value.\\nThis change means a first-time-buying couple with a joint income of £50,000 can now borrow up to £300,000 – up from £225,000 under Nationwide's standard lending terms, and up from £275,000 under Helping Hand.\\nSign up to Business Today\\nGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning\\nafter newsletter promotion\\nNicholas Mendes\\u200b, a mortgage technical manager at the broker John Charcol, said Nationwide's move was 'a gamechanger for first-time buyers' that would 'deliver a powerful boost' towards tackling the significant affordability issues that had locked many out of home ownership.\\nDavid Stirling, an adviser at Mint Mortgages & Protection, said: 'These are significant improvements … potentially increasing borrowing availability by up to 33%.'\\nHelping Hand has helped about 40,000 people on to the property ladder since it was launched three years ago, said Debbie Crosbie, Nationwide's chief executive. 'We want to do more and are boosting the scheme to six times income and increasing the maximum loan size. This, alongside our most recent rate cuts, further strengthens our market-leading position.'\",\n",

       "  'summary': \"The Biden administration announced a sweeping initiative on Monday to ban Chinese-developed software from internet-connected cars in the United States, justifying the move on national security grounds. The action is intended to prevent Chinese intelligence agencies from monitoring the movements of Americans or using the vehicles' electronics as a pathway into the U.S. electric grid or other critical infrastructure.\\nThe move, most likely the last major cutoff of Chinese products into the United States under the Biden administration, follows the same logic that resulted in the ban on Huawei telecommunications equipment and the investigations into Chinese-made cranes operating at American ports.\\nCombined with the effort by Congress to force TikTok to cut its ties with its Chinese owners, the initiative is a major addition to the administration's efforts to seal off what it views as major cybervulnerabilities for the United States. But the effort has, in effect, begun to drop a digital iron curtain between the world's two largest economies, which only two decades ago were declaring that the internet would bind them together.\\nBriefing reporters, administration officials said that national security concerns, not politics, drove the Commerce Department to propose the ban, which officials said would probably be made a permanent rule before President Biden leaves office on Jan. 20. This year, Mr. Biden announced 100 percent tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, saying they were wildly subsidized in China. The announcement was notable because such cars had barely begun to enter the U.S. market — and Mr. Biden explicitly cast it as a way of keeping jobs in America.\",\n",

Amazon has also funded far-right political groups' efforts to undermine women's rights and antitrust legislation, and its retail website has been used by hate groups to raise money and sell products.\\nAt Tesla, the report cites anti-union opposition by the company in the US, Germany, and Sweden; human rights violations within its supply chains; and Elon Musk's personal opposition to unions and democracy, challenges to the NLRB in the US, and his support for the political leaders Donald Trump, Javier Milei in Argentina and Narendra Modi in India.\\nThe report cites Meta, the largest social media company in the world, for its vast role in permitting and enabling far-right propaganda and movements to use its platforms to grow members and garner support in the US and abroad. It also cited retaliation from the company for regulatory measures in Canada, and expensive lobbying efforts against laws to regulate data privacy.\\nGlencore, the largest mining company in the world by revenue, was included in the report for its role in financing campaigns globally against Indigenous communities and activists.\\nBlackstone, the private equity firm led by Stephen Schwarzman, a billionaire backer of Donald Trump, was cited in the report for its roles in funding far-right political movements, investments in fossil fuel projects and deforestation in the Amazon.\\n'Blackstone's network has spent tens of millions of dollars supporting politicians and political forces who promise to prevent or eliminate regulations that might hold it to account,' the report noted.\\nThe Vanguard Group was included in the report due to its role in financing some of the world's most anti-democratic corporations.

       "  'excerpt': 'As artificial intelligence thrusts itself further into our lives, researchers at the Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society are investigating ways to bring it in line with human values',\n",
       "  'summary': \"For many, the seminal work of computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton and his students on deep learning established the University of Toronto as a birthplace for modern AI. Today, AI is rapidly becoming a key tool in our lives, embedded into activities from work and leisure to social policy, the justice system and even warfare. But AI's meteoric rise, while offering huge benefits to society, is creating significant concerns, with world leaders and AI experts – including Hinton himself – warning of multiple dangers and calling for greater regulation of the technology.\\nAI's risks range from the disruption of employment and embedding systemic bias into decision making, to the spread of disinformation and the existential threat of a 'superintelligence' acting beyond human control.\\nTo tackle such threats and harness the beneficial powers of this technology, the University of Toronto's Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society is supporting interdisciplinary research, debate and educational programmes in this area. The aim is to encourage AI developers and policymakers to take a holistic, ethical approach, for the overall benefit of humanity, to the AI systems they develop and implement.\\n'Education must adapt to this new world. We need a whole slew of people working together to figure out the right way to control and regulate AI. The important thing is that we act now,' says David Lie, director of the Schwartz Reisman Institute and a cyber security expert.\\nThe Schwartz Reisman Institute brings together scholars and students from diverse fields such as computing, philosophy, psychology, law and public policy to study the impacts of technology on society. The institute, which has recently appointed renowned AI safety experts Roger Grosse and David Duvenaud as Schwartz Reisman chairs in technology and society, seeks to keep policymakers, technologists and the public informed about the regulation and ethical standards of AI and other technologies. The institute uses a multidisciplinary approach to outline practical solutions to the problems and risks that technology presents to humanity.\\nAI is an area of growing capability and concern, with stark warnings issued by Hinton – University of Toronto professor emeritus and 'godfather of AI' – about the dangers of the technology he helped invent. In a recent paper in the journal Science, he joined 25 experts – including Sheila McIlraith, professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto and associate director at Schwartz Reisman – in highlighting critical problems with AI that needed to be addressed.\\nThe experts called for a greater focus on research and development to ensure AI systems align with human values, for more informed regulation, better oversight of AI systems, and greater understanding of how AI makes decisions.\\nIn a collaborative initiative to address these issues, the Schwartz Reisman Institute has teamed up with the University of Toronto's Department of Computer Science to create a series of course modules on ethics that are embedded into the university's existing computer science undergraduate curriculum. The Embedded Ethics Education Initiative (E3I) aims to implant the seeds of a more thoughtful approach to AI and other technology in the minds of the technology leaders of the future.\\n'We want students to develop ethical sensitivity because they will be on the frontlines when they enter the workforce,' says McIlraith. 'They'll be the ones writing the code, developing the systems and using the data. It is imperative that ethical considerations are part of the fundamental design principles.'\\nMcIlraith says that undergraduates have limited life experiences and may be inclined to build technology that pushes boundaries, rather than contemplating the diversity of stakeholders and end users who may be affected by it, and designing the technology for them. Many of these students go on to work at the big tech firms once they graduate, so learning to identify stakeholders and build technology that benefits this diverse collective is crucial.\\n'We wanted to start the conversations about the ethical side of AI early on, but we absolutely did not want to proselytise. Our aim has been to broaden their thinking about AI's impacts on society through the insertion of ethics modules into select computer science courses rather than to lay down the law,' she says.\\nThe Embedded Ethics Education Initiative integrates ethical concepts into existing courses on specific areas of computing. For instance, a course on computer games includes a discussion about drawing a line between designing games that are highly engaging from those that are addictive. Another course raises questions of privacy in the use of facial recognition technology and how the risks can be mitigated.\\nThe initiative began in 2020 and is being expanded to other courses beyond computer science. In the 2023/24 academic year, total enrolment in computer science courses with E3I programming has exceeded 8,000 students, and another 1,500 students participated in E3I programming in courses outside computer science.\\nAnother initiative is a new course to be run next year by Schwartz Reisman Institute director Lie with associate director Lisa Austin, who is also chair in law and technology at the University of Toronto. The course, digital privacy and privacy regulation, will bring together law and engineering students to jointly tackle problems, learning from each other about the technological and legal implications of a variety of developments in AI and technology.\\n'This multidisciplinary approach to education is a departure from how things are normally done in universities,' says Lie. 'But given the way technology is expanding across society, it doesn't make sense to teach technology separately from everything else that we do.'\\nLie believes that a cross-disciplinary strategy for training AI developers and policymakers is the key to creating a society at ease with AI.\\n'A measure of success would be the creation of a healthy ecosystem where, on balance, we are better off with the AI systems than without them. It will be a society where regulation is carefully and intelligently written and well implemented,' he says.\\n'My vision is to make us one of the leaders. Canada has already contributed greatly to machine learning and AI through the contributions of previous scholars such as Hinton, and I think we have an important role to play in this technology going forward.'\\nMeet the extraordinary community that's pushing the boundaries of what's possible\",\n",

       "  'excerpt': \"'We have to push each other in these situations,' Counsell said.\",\n",
       "  'summary': \"CHICAGO — Chicago Cubs manager Craig Counsell delivered a message that was both so direct and vague enough that it sounded like he called out his entire organization. 'We should be trying to build 90-win teams here' instantly landed as a line that will be repeated throughout another long winter.\\nThe Cubs don't consistently spend money like the Los Angeles Dodgers or New York Yankees, and they don't regularly do more with less, the way the Milwaukee Brewers created that 'big gap' in the National League Central. Year after year, though, the big crowds keep showing up to Wrigley Field, win or lose.\\nCounsell didn't specifically mention Cubs chairman Tom Ricketts, president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer, general manager Carter Hawkins or president of business operations Crane Kenney. But the business and baseball sides of the franchise would ideally create some sort of synergy. Raising the expectations and instilling a greater sense of urgency will be a group effort.\\n'We have to push each other in these situations,' Counsell said. 'That inevitably is going to make for hard decisions. Because it's hard. The thing we want to do is hard. That's going to require hard decisions. But the things worth doing are hard. That's where we got to get to. It's going to be difficult. We're not there.'\\nIt's more about process than personnel\\n'Absolutely,' Counsell said. 'I would jump to process.'\\nCounsell didn't mean that everyone should be fired and the team has to start over. His power, even with a five-year, $40 million contract, isn't unlimited. Parts of the roster are locked into place. But his vast knowledge of the inner workings of Milwaukee's system has given him a different perspective. And the process of evaluating could lead to personnel changes.\\n'It entails everything,' Counsell said. 'You're looking for details. I don't think it's appropriate for me to share some of the details. But it requires us to look in every area, for sure.'\\nDon't focus on the positives\\nKey questions in spring training revolved around: How would Shota Imanaga handle his adjustment to MLB? When would the young talent arrive? And who's on third? The Cubs had already retained the nucleus of an 83-win team and hired one of the best managers in the game, giving them a solid floor.\\nImanaga, who threw seven scoreless innings in Sunday's 5-0 win over the Washington Nationals, is 15-3 with a 2.91 ERA. Pete Crow-Armstrong emerged as a dynamic center fielder. Michael Busch (21 homers, .783 OPS) proved himself as an everyday first baseman. Isaac Paredes, an All-Star third baseman, was added around the trade deadline. Yet the division race still was not close.\\nShota Imanaga has the 3rd most strikeouts by a @Cubs rookie since 1920! pic.twitter.com/sK8mDmSlak\\n— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) September 22, 2024\\n'Seasons like this, there are successes, and there are things that aren't good enough,' Counsell said. 'That leads to your record. That's earned. And none of those are promised — the successes or the failures — moving forward. That's one of the difficult parts about evaluating teams as well. Obviously, we've got to maximize those successes again. We've got to create more successes. Clearly, there wasn't enough.'\\nYoung pitching can't be trusted yet\\nThe Cubs are planning to add an established starting pitcher to a group that includes Imanaga, Justin Steele, Jameson Taillon and Javier Assad. There's ample room for a free agent who would be expected to make 30 starts and could be trusted in a playoff game. It's a clear way to improve one of the team's strengths while also creating options for the bullpen and more depth at Triple-A Iowa. Names like Ben Brown, Jordan Wicks, Hayden Wesneski and Cade Horton should factor into next year's plans, but more as reserves or in supporting roles.\\n'In one sense, you feel like you're in a solid position because we have a number of young pitchers (who) have had success in the big leagues,' Counsell said. 'Now with all of them, there's been injuries. And it's not a big sample as of yet. But that's also kind of the nature of pitching. It's the nature of young pitching. So we're in a good spot in terms of that area of depth. But as we saw this year, it disappeared quickly.'\\nBuilding around Wrigley Field's unpredictability would be a mistake\\nCounsell won't overreact to how the Friendly Confines played this season, turning into one of the worst ballparks for hitters, almost on par with Seattle's T-Mobile Park: 'I don't know what the weather's going to be next year. Until we know that, just get good players.'\\nThere are only theories — such as all the construction around Wrigleyville in recent years — but no concrete answers about the wind patterns and future conditions. Counsell clearly believes this roster needs significant changes, but Wrigley Field alone is not a reason to seek out different types of offensive players.\\n'Who knows what the weather's going to be?' Counsell said. 'It led to a lower run-scoring environment (this year). We pitched really, really well here. It was hard to score runs at Wrigley Field this year for both sides. It was the nature of the weather this year. That played a part in it. But making personnel decisions on that at this point doesn't seem logical.'\\nProspects can wait until next year\\nWith the Cubs mathematically eliminated from the playoff race, the final week of the season could have been a chance for the club to take a look at Kevin Alcántara and Owen Caissie. Counsell, however, said, 'There's no plans for that right now.'\\nAlcántara, the 6-foot-6 center fielder acquired in the Anthony Rizzo trade, is already on the 40-man roster. Caissie, the left-handed slugger who was packaged in the Yu Darvish deal, will be added this winter to protect him from the Rule 5 draft. Alcántara and Caissie are part of a strong group of position players who ended this season at the Triple-A level. Counsell has been trying to maintain an all-162 mentality.\\n'Nothing changes,' Counsell said. 'You just go out and you play the game. You respect the game. You respect your teammates. That's it.'\",\n",

       "  'summary': \"Erase the ranks. Every season is strange in its own way, I concede, but this one seems extreme. There is just a paucity of points and many of those that come are from our benches or the waiver wire. The inefficiency measured this way is off the charts.\\nThe Dolphins offense was as 'frag-i'lay' as the leg lamp in 'A Christmas Story.' Yet the Dolphins had no Plan B for life without Tua Tagovailoa. I did not get the De'Von Achane victory laps last week after his heavy workload. Those touches just don't mean much if the offense can't function, and this one can't without Tua.\\nPlan C is Jets 2023 castoff Tim Boyle. You probably have to play Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle given they still rank somewhere in the top 40 at their position, but it's brutal. There's no guarantee that Tagovailoa is going to be back after three more games, either. The NHL 's New York Rangers had a player who missed 70 games after repeated concussions. It's in the doctor's hands now.\\nMiami averaged 3.7 yards per play against a defense that could not stop New England last week.\\nThere should be a running back change in Tampa Bay. Rachaad White is terrible. Bucky Irving has been solid.\\nBucs RBs this season:\\nRachaad White:\\n31 ATT, 66 Rush YDS, 2.1 YPC\\nBucky Irving:\\n25 ATT, 154 Rush YDS, 6.2 YPC\\n— Frank Ammirante (@FAmmiranteTFJ) September 22, 2024\\nSome people thought Denver 's Javonte Williams scored from in close but the play was reviewed. After that, on fourth down, Jaleel McLaughlin had one of the best runs I've seen in that situation. Williams later fumbled, leading to a Bucs TD. But a third RB, Tyler Badie, was inserted into the mix, and he was by far the most effective. So this is a mess.\\nI may as well concede defeat with Malik Nabers. Clearly the Cardinals made a bigger mistake than me in not drafting Nabers over Marvin Harrison Jr. in reality. But I thought the price for Nabers was WR25, at best, and he was going at WR19 at the end of draft season. That was clearly a bargain. Last week, we could have discounted the volume for (lack of) quality of the opponent (the Commanders). But the Browns are a good defense.\\nDaniel Jones looked competent. A lot of this had to do with Nabers, of course. Usually the receiver has to be the last piece, a mantra first preached by Bill Walsh. But Nabers seems to be a rare exception to that rule.\\nDevin Singletary managers lost a walk-in touchdown when Singletary took a knee at the 1-yard line outside the two-minute warning.\\nSticking with Amari Cooper was the right move given he entered the week on pace for 145 targets. But Deshaun Watson is so bad. When you add the sacks, the Browns averaged a pathetic 3.3 yards per pass. Watson should be benched, but I can't see the Browns doing it as Watson's dead cap next year is $172.7 million. Just his cap number next year for 2025 alone is $72.9 million.\\nDerrick Henry did what everyone expected him to do against the Cowboys, who are soft against the run. I don't get the Ravens not wanting to use Henry regularly coming into this week just because teams assumed they'd run when Henry was on the field. Fine. Now you've dictated the defense and should work off that.\\nDallas showed spunk. I do think Dak Prescott is a good QB. But they just can't play with any kind of balance because their defense won't let them. The Dallas defense is 'doomsday' now for its offense. I'm not going to read too much of anything into all the fourth-quarter mad scramble stats.\\nWe're learning a lot about the quarterback position. Sometimes the team can sink the QB and other times the QB can sink the team. It can be hard to tell the difference. We saw evidence of the former with Andy Dalton replacing Bryce Young and the Panthers putting up 437 yards against a Raiders defense that is okay.\\nAs for Dalton, I have few values in life, but a QB throwing for 300 yards with three TDs and no picks being a waiver-wire pickup is definitely one of them.\\nThat Rams comeback against the Niners is a testament to the greatness of their coach Sean McVay and QB Matthew Stafford. It was like Stafford and Kyren Williams were playing with the Week 2 preseason roster. But they somehow created 27 points.\\nOh, 26 touches and three TDs for Williams. No punt returns, BTW. (Xavier Smith won the game with one late.)\\nThis was supposed to be the Brandon Aiyuk 'to the moon' game but that was Jauan Jennings, who was mostly on our benches or on waivers instead. He scored 50 points. Aiyuk scored 9.8. It defies reason.\\nJames Conner had averaged 22.4 points in his past seven games with Kyler Murray, but the Arizona offense had a big bite taken out of it by the Lions. By the way, do you know cats kill 1-to-4 billion birds each year in just the United States? Add one more to that given what the Detroit cats did to the redbirds.\\nIt was a bad day for Jameson Williams managers. He was just not seriously involved in the game plan. It's troubling. He's the prototypical flex10 flex WR because he's so volatile. The Lions clearly want to run the ball 40 times a game. I don't blame them.\\nMalik Willis has been amazing and you have to tip your cap to the coaching staff and play calling. I would have thought his chance of success was about zero given he just arrived in Green Bay and had been awful in Tennessee.\\nIt wasn't just garbage time for Emanuel Wilson. He looked better than Josh Jacobs, it's fair to say. But Jacobs is getting paid so don't worry if you roster him. Jacobs managers have to get Wilson though. I don't even like handcuffs; but this one is a must.\\nGreat day for Zach Charbonnet and who knows when Kenneth Walker will be back with his repeated groin/abdominal injuries. (He's week to week.)\\nCaleb Williams wasn't good in a real way but put up numbers. Baby steps. I consider that very encouraging. Cole Kmet is another monster scorer we wasted because the Bears are so stupid that they mothballed Kmet all summer and the first two games — the new OC loves the lifeless corpse of Gerald Everett for some reason. Even with Keenan Allen out, you couldn't count on snaps until you saw them. Now we have, but what a needless waste.\\nYes, Rome Odunze looked good, but remember this Colts pass defense is probably the worst one in the NFL. Would Williams have been better off right now with an offensive lineman in the top 10? Probably. There's also no running game.\\nNo, I'm not apologizing for saying to draft D'Andre Swift at ADP. The Bears made the mistake, not me. I'm not qualified to scout running backs changing teams in March, and I believe the job is the most important thing. They paid for a 60% snap guy and his ADP was 50% tops. Now he looks like the worst running back in football, so clearly Chicago had no vision for the player. Swift had 13 carries, with a long of four yards, incredibly.\\nAnthony Richardson is awful in reality and thus can easily be awful in fantasy against anyone, anytime. Sunday was one of those times. The Colts average a gross 50 plays per game.\\nSam Darnold is the MVP so far with eight TD passes for the unbeaten Vikings, including four on Sunday against Houston. Darnold had a fifth TD called back by an illegal pick which was just poorly executed by Aaron Jones but otherwise legal (he just stood there instead of continuing a 'route').\\nC.J. Stroud is still a young player and just could not deal with the defensive looks Brian Flores was throwing at him. The same thing happened to Brock Purdy in Week 2. I would not worry. But another bad week for Tank Dell is worrisome despite everyone telling you not to worry because they just hate Stefon Diggs (team-high 12 targets) and want Dell to happen SOOOO badly. Dell is a fourth WR in your flex, too, if you play that deep. Nothing more.\\nDid we start Dallas Goedert? Probably not the way we're rolling. He had three catches over 30 yards, which is unreal for a tight end. Only Rob Gronkowski and George Kittle have a game with three of these receptions as a tight end since 2010, according to TruMedia.\\nSaquon Barkley could not look any better right now. His expected value goes up or down about 15% depending on whether the 'Tush Push' is effective. It was not vs. the Saints. It was last week. It should be scrapped, in my opinion.\\nDerek Carr showed us we can never really trust him.\\nI have to give Justin Fields credit for doing what needs to be done. He's not taking as many sacks. He's not hurting the team. He's letting the defense win the game. It helps when the opponent loses its three best offensive players like the Chargers did. Justin Herbert has a high ankle sprain and was in a walking boot, so he probably should not go next week against the Chiefs. Tackles Joe Alt and Rashawn Slater may also be out, and Slater (pec) could be out a while.\",\n",

       "  'excerpt': 'Jackson threw for a touchdown and rushed for another while relying on veteran running back Derrick Henry.',\n",
       "  'summary': \"By Jeff Zrebiec, Jon Machota, Saad Yousuf and Alex Andrejev\\nThe Baltimore Ravens and Lamar Jackson survived a late scare from the Dallas Cowboys to secure their first win of the season Sunday.\\nThe Ravens' two-time MVP quarterback threw for a touchdown and rushed for another while relying on veteran running back Derrick Henry, the four-time Pro Bowler Baltimore signed in March to further ignite their ground game. Henry added two TDs in the win.\\nThe Cowboys lacked the same spark — even Tom Brady expressed frustration with Dallas' offense while in the broadcast booth. Although three touchdowns in the fourth quarter kept the game close, Dallas couldn't complete the comeback and dropped to 1-2.\\nRavens prove they have offensive identity\\nAll the talk during the week was about how the Ravens lacked an offensive identity through the first two weeks. Well, they found one Sunday. The Ravens have always been at their best when they are relying heavily on their run game and getting downhill. They made it clear that was their intention and they never really swayed from it.\\nJackson played another strong game, but he was never really asked to do a lot. Baltimore threw the ball just 15 times. The Ravens will need to do more through the air going forward, but with the Cowboys' issues stopping the run, offensive coordinator Todd Monken stuck to the script Sunday. — Jeff Zrebiec, Ravens staff writer\\nHow Baltimore rode its big back\\nHenry, who lives in Dallas in the offseason, had interest in signing with the Cowboys in the offseason The Cowboys, though, weren't all that interested. Henry showed the Cowboys what they were missing, rushing for 151 yards and two touchdowns on 25 carries and adding a catch for 23 yards. The Ravens needed every one of those yards to close out the Cowboys. Henry now has four touchdowns in three games with his new team. — Zrebiec\\nRavens still have a penalty problem\\nThis is perhaps nitpicky in what was an otherwise dominant win for much of four quarters, but the Ravens still have a penalty problem that they need to figure out. They entered the game ranked 30th in penalties and 31st in penalty yards. They went out against the Cowboys and added 13 more penalties for 105 yards.\\nA few of the offensive penalties contributed to stopping Ravens drives. Some penalties are the cost of doing business, but the Ravens need to cut down on the unnecessary ones. — Zrebiec\\nCowboys offense found spark, but not enough\\nIt was a matter of too little, too late for the Cowboys' offense. After sputtering for the better part of the first 50 minutes of the game, Dak Prescott led a fierce rally, aided by an onside kick recovery. The offense was able to march down the field, with Prescott distributing the ball evenly between his targets. There simply wasn't enough time on the clock, though, to rebound from a slew of mistakes early in the game.\\nCeeDee Lamb 's fumble inside the red zone in the first half loomed large, as it wiped out a potential touchdown, but at least a field goal, which proved to be the difference in the game. Tyler Guyton 's holding penalty at the end of the first half also was the potential difference of a touchdown or field goal. The offense left too many plays on the field and asked for a lot from their struggling defense, which couldn't give them the final stop they needed. — Saad Yousuf, Cowboys staff writer\\nDefensive woes sink Dallas\\nFor the second consecutive week, the Cowboys lose and it's on the defense. Too many open receivers, too many big runs, too many big plays allowed when the game was still up for grabs. Last week it was Alvin Kamara and Derek Carr looking like one of the best running back/quarterback duos in the league. This week it was Henry and Jackson.\\nDallas' offense did everything it could to get back in the game late. The defense had a chance to finally do its part again. Facing third-and-six with 2:18 to play, Trevon Diggs left too much cushion for Jackson to find Zay Flowers for a first down. After using all their timeouts, the Cowboys still had a chance right after the two-minute warning.\\nBut Jackson again made a play with his feet, getting the final first down needed to run out the clock.\\nWe know there are issues at defensive tackle, but there's plenty of blame to go around on Dallas' defense that reaches beyond just the middle of the defensive front. — Jon Machota, Cowboys staff writer\\nRequired reading\",\n",

       "  'summary': \"A radical scheme to speed up the building of more apartment blocks in towns and cities – as opposed to individual houses and bungalows – has been announced by the prime minister on the eve of the Labour party conference.\\nKeir Starmer told the Observer in an exclusive interview that the new system of 'planning passports' would be a 'game-changer' as the government strives to build 1.5m new homes within five years.\\nUnder the scheme, any proposal that meets high standards for design and quality will be speeded through the planning process with the default decision for planning authorities being 'yes'.\\nAs one of Labour's first acts in government Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, announced the return of compulsory housebuilding targets.\\nAlthough the Conservatives brought in such targets for local authorities in 2019, they watered them down in December 2023 when the then communities secretary Michael Gove published a new National Planning Policy Framework.\\nGovernment sources said the idea was not to build more tower blocks, but rather quality multi-dwelling buildings. This, they said, would mean 'fewer bungalows in Bermondsey or Birmingham and more densification in UK cities from Leeds to Liverpool'.\\nStarmer said ministers had held extensive discussions with developers since Labour came to power. 'They're very pleased to see these plans. They want to get on with it. We are absolutely determined to deliver.'\\nLabour is emphasising the need for cities both to 'grow out' by releasing more 'grey belt' land, but also to 'densify' within their existing boundaries with brownfield areas coming first, and grey belt second.\\nA source said: 'Only by building denser cities can we drive growth and prosperity across the country, because denser cities mean people are closer to work, have better transport infrastructure, and business has the widest talent pool.'\\nSign up to Observed\\nAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers\\nafter newsletter promotion\\nStarmer will try to use his conference speech on Tuesday to spell out his vision of what a Labour government can deliver in terms of improved public services, more housing and a dynamic economy.\\nAn official added: 'This work cannot be delivered effectively by central government alone. That's why this Labour government will continue to work hand in glove with mayors, local government leaders and developers to deliver the homes people need, a partnership based on collective responsibility and mutual accountability to deliver the change working people voted for.'\",\n",

       "  'excerpt': \"With petrol prices and inflation both low, motorists can absorb a reversing of Sunak's 5p cut – and it could even boost electric car sales\",\n",
       "  'summary': \"A chancellor desperate for ready cash, as Rachel Reeves finds herself, has one immediate source of new funds: increasing the tax on petrol again.\\nMore than 14 years have passed since fuel duty was last increased, in 2010. That's a legacy of concessions by the Conservatives to the car lobby. Now it's time to tell drivers that the days of annual freezes are over, and that the UK's car mileage tax needs to be higher to reduce emissions and limit climate change.\\nAnd what a moment for Labour to raise an extra £1bn a year over the next six months, as well as £2bn a year from next April that is pencilled into government forecasts but recent history tells us was likely to be cancelled.\\nA weak global economic outlook means oil demand is down, and so are prices at the pumps. If ever motorists were going to be able to carry on driving without feeling the pain of a tax hike, that time is now.\\nSince April, petrol prices have fallen from an average £1.49 a litre to £1.36. Diesel costs an average of £1.40 a litre when five months ago the price was £1.57.\\nFurther evidence of the good times we are enjoying can be found in the RAC Foundation price tracker, which shows petrol and diesel prices falling from £1.87 and £1.96 respectively since the post-pandemic peak in the summer of 2022. If Reeves adds 5p a litre to the cost, motorists will still be 7p a litre better off than they were in April.\\nThe Tory administration had a plan to reverse a 5p emergency cut made in 2022 which was always considered temporary. Reverting to a tax level of 57.95p a litre was supposed to take place next April, which convenient left this tricky decision to the current government.\\nReeves could easily go ahead with that plan, but bring it forward to budget day on 30 October, and in the same breath announce that she is restoring an inflation link to ratchet up fuel duty each year in line with average price increases. Such a move would have the added benefit of helping revive the switch to electric cars, which has stalled this year after playing a big part in new car sales early in the decade.\\nConsumers always consider relative prices, and the declining cost of petrol and diesel will have played a significant role in their decision to delay the jump to electric.\\nData from the Office for Budget Responsibility shows that fuel duty was worth 2% of national income in 2000; 24 years later it is worth just 1%. So while the tax still makes up a large proportion of the cost of petrol at the pump, it has become a smaller slice of average household incomes.\\nThat's not to say it will be an easy sell, especially to businesses affected by transport costs. And oil prices on international markets can jump, which would see motorists facing a double whammy at the pump.\\nThat looks unlikely at the moment. Much of the reason for the drop in oil prices this year lies in China's economic slowdown. Despite having invested in renewables, China remains by far the world's largest consumer of oil, and whenever its economy falters, as it is doing now, oil prices fall.\\nThere is, however, likely to be a backlash from the haulage industry, which is suffering hugely in the post-Brexit era. Higher diesel prices are the last thing owners of big lorries, coaches and industrial equipment want right now, when they are already coping with a shortage of drivers, and rising prices for parts, repairs and replacement vehicles.\\nThe transport industry will say that a combination of taxes and charges will feed through to higher prices in the shops and put them at a disadvantage compared with foreign competition.\\nIt is always difficult to calculate the relative position of transport costs in the round from one country to another. But the fact that inflation is low and heading downwards will offset higher transport prices.\\nThere is also a danger that Reeves will be portrayed as a Scrooge-like figure, scrimping and taxing while much of the nation struggles on meagre rations.\\nShe will need to portray a positive outlook when delivering her budget speech, even though she will feel like a shopkeeper staring into an empty cash register.\\nCar drivers complain about the defunding of local authorities and how it has triggered a dramatic increase in potholes (to such an extent that DIY chains now sell buckets of ready-to-use tarmac for filling said holes).\\nPromising that Labour will do what the Tories only talked about and fix the nation's potholes will go some way to lighten the mood and mitigate the effect of higher fuel tax. Potholes are even more of a problem for electric cars than for their petrol cousins, which gives urgency to a project that is good for the planet.\",\n",

       "  'excerpt': 'Business intelligence firms who compile reports on corporate subjects find their targets are fighting back',\n",
       "  'summary': \"In John le Carré's landmark espionage novel Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, undersecretary Oliver Lacon \\xadoutlines the obvious \\xadproblem in unearthing a traitor at the heart of the British secret service. 'It's the oldest question of all, George,' he muses to the hero, George Smiley. 'Who can spy on the spies? Who can smell out the fox without running with him?'\\nYet in the modern setting of \\xadcorporate intelligence – an industry that collates research on the business world and employs its fair share of former state-agency operatives – there appears to be no such issue.\\nOver the past few years there has been increasing scrutiny on an industry which has always had a reputation for operating in the shadows. This trend may increase now that Varun Chandra, who previously ran the London corporate intelligence firm Hakluyt, has joined the Labour government as a special adviser for business and investment.\\nThat scrutiny is most obvious in the publicity surrounding the scandals that occasionally befall the sector. Examples have recently included allegations of 'intimidation' and covert surveillance by one operator, Kroll, as it tried to track hedge fund managers betting on falls in the share price of now-disgraced Wirecard; or Lynton Crosby's CT Group, which this year stood accused of unlawfully gathering privileged information in a high court battle over a multibillion-dollar estate linked to a dead Russian billionaire.\\nBoth firms have said they complied with applicable laws and regulations. CT Group has said it denies the allegations in full, and last year Kroll also denied the allegations in a claim made against it in full. Kroll did not respond when asked for the current status of the claim.\\nOther types of scrutiny are also combining to complicate the business of these corporate investigators, whose due diligence reports are routinely commissioned by western companies as they look for comfort when conducting business with unfamiliar entities and tycoons from overseas markets.\\nSometimes these checks may be part of a company's legal responsibilities to ensure they are not breaking any laws – yet recent incidents have complicated these efforts and sent shock waves through the industry.\\nFor example, when Chinese authorities raided the Beijing office of Mintz Group last year, the US corporate investigations and due diligence firm had its operations shut down and five of its Chinese staff detained. The company said it was confident neither it nor its employees had done anything wrong.\\nMintz, which lists 12 offices around the world, said it had received no legal notice about the reasons for the raid, but it was later fined about $1.5m for doing 'unapproved statistical work', according to a Beijing Municipal Bureau of Statistics notice.\\nThe effect has been to reduce the already small pool of analysts in China who can conduct due diligence on local companies.\\nNicholas Bortman, a partner at the corporate intelligence firm Raedas, said: 'Companies in the US and Europe sourcing [products and services] from mainland China are facing huge pressure from regulators and national security interests to investigate their supply chains. But the raid on Mintz Group last year cast a chill across the sector.\\n'It's not the first time the Chinese government has taken action against investigators. But the scale and profile of the raid and its impact on Mintz got everyone's attention.'\\nBortman said that the risks now associated with carrying out such work in China were prompting operators to pull back, or at least act with extreme caution, making it harder for western companies to obtain reliable information on the country's markets.\\nHe added: 'In the past, Hong Kong was something of a bridge into the mainland. But the national security law and policy changes in Beijing led to a similar exodus there.\\n'No question, the sector's ability to gather information in China has been degraded. Yet the demand is more acute than ever.'\\nBack in London, there is a separate issue whereby 'spying on the spies' is undermining the industry's ability to conduct due diligence on targets, who may include oligarchs or secretive tycoons.\\nSign up to Observed\\nAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers\\nafter newsletter promotion\\nFor a couple of years now, private investigations firms have been wrestling with frequent requests under the UK's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which allows individuals to gain access to the personal information that companies hold on them.\\nThese demands, known as data subject access requests (DSARs), are being sent to UK corporate intelligence firms by City lawyers representing some of the world's more colourful business figures.\\n'Along with other firms in our sector, we get these ongoing DSARs from representatives of oligarch-type individuals,' said one London-based corporate intelligence boss.\\n'What they are trying to do is to shut down the corporate intelligence companies looking at them and stop us writing anything contentious or controversial in our reports – especially if the information comes from human sources of intelligence.'\\nWhile the intelligence firms may resist, stall and redact information they end up supplying in response to these requests, they are under a legal obligation to comply, as the industry does not benefit from the DSAR exemptions that apply to the media.\\nThe only way to counteract this, says the private investigations boss, 'is to say 'bring it on' and fight them every inch of the way. Most don't want to go to court to cleanse their reputation.'\\nHowever, when the oligarch's lawyers see the report on their client, they may follow up with demands for the investigators to stop investigating, delete any report, withdraw any unkind conclusions and promise to never investigate anything to do with their client's business dealings again.\\nThe lawyers might also threaten to sue or pursue anybody they now suspect as the source of any leak.\\nIt is a game that threatens the corporate investigations industry – and one that differs only slightly from the ones that Smiley played in le Carré's novels. As the spycatcher said to his rival Karla in Tinker, Tailor: 'We're getting to be old men, and we've both spent our lives looking for the weaknesses in one another's systems.'\",\n",

Last year, we became the first supermarket to introduce our budget 'Savers' range into Morrisons Daily stores nationwide.'\\nEle Clark, the retail editor at Which?, said: 'Unfortunately, many people are without easy access to transport or online deliveries which leaves them reliant on smaller nearby stores.\\n'Convenience stores may often be easier to travel to and handy for shoppers who need to stock up on a few essentials, but people who have to use them regularly will be spending significantly more over the course of a year than those with access to larger supermarkets.'\\nWhich? found those who shop regularly in smaller outlets face a big mark-up on essentials such as milk, bread and butter.\\nAll three supermarket convenience stores charged 8% more for two pints of own-label, semi-skimmed milk – with or without a loyalty card – according to the study.\\nBoth Tesco and Sainsbury's said their smaller stores tended to be in city or town centre locations where rents, rates and other operating costs are higher relative to their size.

The deal is expected to close before the end of the year, and would include the chain's offshoot hotel brand, Studio 6.\\nOyo expanded into the United States in 2019, and has recently ramped up efforts to expand further. It currently operates more than 300 hotels domestically. The company, which specializes in budget hotels and proudly describes itself as 'a start-up,' had received a large investment from SoftBank. But some troubling incidents in India in recent years raised questions about some of its business practices.\\nMotel 6 was founded in 1962 in Santa Barbara, Calif., and has been an indelible part of Americana for its basic accommodations. The Motel 6 name originally came from the company's offering of an all-cash $6-a-night rate. Motel 6 and Studio 6 currently have roughly 1,500 hotels across the United States and Canada, Blackstone said.\\nGautam Swaroop, the chief executive of Oyo International, praised Motel 6's 'strong brand recognition, financial profile and network in the U.S.' He added, 'This acquisition is a significant milestone for a start-up company like us to strengthen our international presence.'\\nBlackstone purchased Motel 6 in 2012 for $1.9 billion.\\n'This transaction is a terrific outcome for investors and is the culmination of an ambitious business plan that more than tripled our investors' capital and generated over $1 billion in profit over our hold period,' Rob Harper, a senior managing director at Blackstone, said in a statement.\",\n",

The company's market value has since surged on the takeover interest to almost 675p, a market capitalisation of almost £5.5bn.\\nREA has until the end of the month to make a formal offer for Rightmove or give up its pursuit of the company under UK takeover rules known informally as PUSU, 'put up or shut up'.\\nAfter making the initial offer, REA said if it was eventually able to complete a deal for Rightmove it would open a secondary listing on the London Stock Exchange, arguing that this would 'provide the opportunity for a wider pool of investors to gain exposure to a global and diversified digital property company' on the LSE.\\nAfter news of a potential bid by REA, Peel Hunt analysts said Rightmove was the 'cheapest publicly listed classifieds businesses in Europe'.\\nThe UK online property market has been the focus of increasing merger and acquisition activity in recent years.

Personally, I begin with broad political and geopolitical concerns, not specifically financial ones, leading with the presidential election in the United States, which is still too close to call. Then, when I can stand it, I survey tensions around the globe, from the hostilities in the Middle East to Russia's war in Ukraine to incipient conflicts involving China in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea.\\nThere's no shortage of explicit economic and financial issues percolating within U.S. borders, either. The Fed depicted its decision to reduce the benchmark federal funds rate by half a percentage point as a prophylactic measure, aimed at heading off an unemployment spiral. The economy looks fairly strong now, but unemployment has already begun to rise and in many past cycles, slowing job growth has culminated in mass layoffs. The potential for a widening economic slowdown that becomes a full-blown recession will be with us for some time.\",\n",

The country's PC shipments declined by 6 per cent in Q2, with the consumer and commercial sectors falling by 3 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively, as per a Canalys report.\\nAnalyst Emma Xu said that the competitive dynamics of China's PC market are rapidly increasing in complexity. 'Local AI regulations have constrained the full deployment of Microsoft's Copilot in Mainland China. This is pushing vendors toward localised strategies to develop AI PCs, either by integrating in-house AI assistants or by building their own AI application ecosystems through collaboration with developers,' Xu explained.\\nThe forecast anticipates 13 per cent penetration of AI-capable PCs in Greater China in 2024. According to the report, vendors will need to make consistent portfolio investments to execute on their AI PC roadmaps and adapt their go-to-market strategies to be flexible and localised to the unique market requirements.\\nIn contrast, tablet sales increased by 20 per cent to reach 7.8 million units in the April-June quarter, driven by increasing adoption and online promotions. The tablet market is highly competitive, as more smartphone vendors expand their portfolios to include tablets, the report mentioned.\\nAccording to Xu, the AI opportunity is attracting more vendors from the education and Internet sectors into the devices market, driving the development of kids' tablets with educational content in Mainland China. To drive stronger business outcomes, vendors must focus on market expansion and differentiation to enhance user experiences and outcomes.

That is Atlas9.\\nThe 46,000-square-foot, $26.7 million entertainment venue is being constructed as part of the Homefield project near 94th Street and State Avenue in Kansas City, Kansas. The project targets a grand opening next summer.\\nexpand\\nIt is the brainchild of Overland Park-based Dimensional Innovations, which built a reputation for creating unique and interesting building spaces and interactive exhibits ranging from the Kansas City Royals Hall of Fame to the Museum at Prairiefire to augmented-reality displays at American Century Investments' headquarters. The company teamed up with Swell Spark \\u2014 operator of Blade & Timber ax-throwing facilities and Breakout KC \\u2014 to operate Atlas9. Quixotic, the Kanas City-based performance art collective, will add its unique expertise to the project, as well.\\n'What we do is create remarkable experiences, and most of the time those are nonfiction stories,' Dimensional Innovations CEO Tucker Trotter said. 'This is an opportunity to create something that's completely based on fiction. We believe people need experiences now more than ever, and we get to create something where they're going to be a part of the story. We don't always get that much flexibility. It puts a tremendous amount of pressure on us, but it's been really fun and fueled a lot of the passions and energy of our internal team. Everyone wants to work on this project because it's so exciting.'\\nexpand\\nTrotter said Atlas 9 will draw from everything his organization learned since it was founded in 1993. It will pay homage to the company's roots of helping AMC Theaters build interesting megaplexes and combine years of experience creating cutting-edge interactive exhibits for museums, children's hospitals and professional sports venues.\\nThe company's work, if not its name, has fans nationwide. Sports fans know it for projects like an updated Minnie & Paul Celebration sign and new 12-foot-diameter baseball-shaped sign at the Minnesota Twins' Target Field home or the newly iconic Al Davis Memorial Torch in Las Vegas' Allegiant Stadium. Children and parents have been positively distracted by decorations and interactive displays at children's hospitals in Kansas City and Columbia and an immersive CreatureVerse at the Connecticut Children's Medical Center. Tourists see the company's handiwork in a life-sized dinosaur bursting out of the side of the Arizona Museum of Natural History and Malala exhibit at the Children's Museum of Indianapolis.\\nHere's a look at Dimensional Innovations' diverse portfolio of creations.\\nView Slideshow 13 photos\\nexpand\\nexpand\\nexpand\\nexpand\\nexpand\\nexpand\\nexpand\\nRandall Statler, creative director for Dimensional Innovations, leads the effort on Atlas9. His vision is to create a building full of rooms that each offer a unique experience. Guests can choose which direction to go, and their choices drive the overarching story thread.\\n'You're basically walking through this and unpacking this narrative story in a nonlinear way,' Statler said. 'If you take a left, you're going to interpret and digest the narrative in a different way than the person who goes right. So everyone might meet in the middle and have a different tack on where they've been and where they're going to go.'\\nStatler envisions rooms incorporating art, light, sound, moving imagery and performances by Quixotic.\\nSwell Spark CEO Matt Baysinger said the venue leans heavily on Kansas City's artistic community.\\n\\\"There will be people who show up just because they want to see the incredible art, which is why some people will put this in the museum category,' Baysinger said. 'But we also know that calling it a museum doesn't do justice for what this thing actually is because it's a hyper-immersive activity. All of us at Dimensional Innovations, Quixotic and Swell Spark are experience enthusiasts. This isn't something that you go to, walk around, look at the art and say, 'That's cool.' It's deeper and richer than that because you get to actually experience and interact with the artistic components themselves.'\\nexpand\\nBaysinger called Atlas9 one of the most rewarding projects he's worked on in the past decade. He called the people working on it a 'dream team' that considers all ideas, even if they seem impossible.\\n'It's been really fun to realize what we are capable of, sometimes in a scary way,' Baysinger said. 'Some of the ideas come out, and I'll scratch my head because the logistics and complications of putting it together seem asinine, and I'm thinking there is no way to do it. Then Randall (Statler) comes back after the weekend and says his team figured it out and all the technology works. Quixotic is a big part of it, as well, and we get to work alongside some of the most incredible performers on Earth, who will be woven into the fabric of Atlas9, as well. Folks are going to come into this with expectations that it is small and realize as soon as they step through the door that what we're doing here is big.'\\nThe goals for Atlas9 certainly aren't small. It's designers want it to be one of Kansas City's top attractions, right up there with barbecue and the Kansas City Chiefs. They hope it becomes a must-see venue not only for people in the Kansas City area, but worldwide. It's intentionally targeting an opening before Kansas City hosts matches for the 2026 World Cup to give it the best opportunity to make an impression in a global way.\\n'We want this to speak to the modernity of the local art scene,' Statler said. 'Kansas City has already been on the trajectory of establishing artistic credibility on a regional and national stage. This is the right time and the right thing to reward that inertia and have it really pay off. It just feels natural and right.'\",\"rights\":\"bizjournals.com\",\"rank\":503,\"topic\":\"business\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"James Dornbrook\",\"media\":\"https://media.bizj.us/view/img/12838124/atlas9-containment-zone-marquee-copy*1200xx3129-1757-0-293.jpg\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":\"@KCBizjournal\",\"_score\":null,\"_id\":\"12eefea9d516d934ed08a827537565a7\"},{\"title\":\"Sergey Lavrov believes fighting for victory with nuclear weapons is \\\"senseless\\\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"published_date\":\"2024-09-29 15:00:10\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.msn.com/en-za/news/other/sergey-lavrov-believes-fighting-for-victory-with-nuclear-weapons-is-senseless/ar-AA1rpJJU\",\"clean_url\":\"msn.com\",\"excerpt\":null,\"summary\":\"Sergey Lavrov said using nuclear weapons at all costs to win the war was \\\"senseless\\\".\\nRussia's foreign minister launched a series of criticisms against the West during a speech to the United Nations on Saturday, also pointing out that Russia can use its nuclear arsenal in the event of a serious threat.\\nThe top diplomat argued that the West was using Ukraine as an excuse \\\"to defeat\\\" Moscow strategically.\\n\\\"I'm not going to talk here about the senselessness and the danger of the very idea of trying to fight to victory with a nuclear power, which is what Russia is,\\\" he said.\\nEarlier this week, Vladimir Putin hinted that he had lowered his conditions for deploying his nuclear arsenal in Ukraine as Kyiv seeks US approval to use their weapons directly on Russian soil.\\nThis week, Joe Biden announced that $2.7 billion in new military aid would be allocated to Ukraine, but this will not include long-range weapons, something Volodymyr Zelenskyy had been hopeful to obtain for months.\\nRussian nuclear warheads have been stored in Belarus since last year.\\n(QG - Source : Associated Press / Picture: \\u00a9 Pixabay)\\nBe sure to read all our articles on MSN by subscribing to our content.

After Pittsburgh's last game, Harris was seen in the locker room with a sling over his arm. Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said there would be \\\"no limitations for Naj\\\" heading into Week 4. If he isn't fully healthy, the Colts' defense needs to take advantage of playing against a worsened rushing attack. Backup running back Jaylen Warren will also miss the game for Pittsburgh, making it an ideal situation for a Colts run defense that had a bounce-back performance last week. On top of running back injuries, the Steelers will be without starting guard Isaac Seumalo. It'll be backups against backups in the trenches on Sunday afternoon.\\nStop Drives in the Red Zone: The Steelers' offense has the worst red zone conversion rate in the league, only turning 25% of their trips into touchdowns. Living on field goals isn't sustainable for any team, making it ultra-important that the Colts' defense kills drives before they turn into six points. The secondary will play a big part in this, especially when looking at the Pittsburgh receiving corps. George Pickens stands out as the main red zone threat, but no other Steelers receiver is listed as over 6-foot-1. If the Colts can clamp down on a smaller group of pass catchers, it would help take some weight off the expectations of Anthony Richardson and the Indianapolis offense.\\nForce Justin Fields to Throw it Deep: The Steelers are ranked in the bottom 10 of the league in yards per attempt, meaning short passes are the lifeblood of the offense. Forcing Justin Fields to make risky reads would help the Colts' defense a lot, especially if he is forced to aim it toward safety Julian Blackmon. In Gus Bradley's defense, that may be a tough ask. Sitting in a zone means the quarterback prefers to find the empty space, which usually isn't deep down the field. Changing up the scheme a little bit could help Colts defenders make big-time plays against a quarterback who's only turned the ball over twice this season. Time of possession has not supported the Colts in the past, so small plays that add up could be poisonous for Indy. Forcing 50-50 balls is a necessity for the defense so they can stay off the field and keep the rock in Richardson's hands.Retractable roof/window stadium (closed).

The Sooners were without five receivers and Taylor Tatum , while the defense was missing starting cheetah Kendel Dolby . That led to the Sooners playing several depth pieces on both sides of the ball.\\nAUBURN, Alabama \\u2014 The Sooners somehow escaped with a 27-21 win over Auburn on Saturday, scoring 17 unanswered points to rally late and stun the Tigers.\\n1. Gavin Sawchuk... as the third-down running back?\\nWith Taylor Tatum unavailable, it was expected that Sawchuk would see an increase in snaps. He saw 19 snaps against Auburn, a significant uptick from the seven he saw against Tennessee.\\nHowever, he wasn't really utilized as ball-carrier. The Sooners essentially utilized him as a third-down running back primarily tasked with pass blocking. 13 of his 19 snaps came on passing downs and he ran nine routes, though he wasn't targeted. He's also credited with seven snaps, though those likely came on scrambles from Michael Hawkins.\\nSawchuk only saw one carry and it was his best of the season, as he gashed Auburn for 16 yards. But the play was called back on a hold by Jake Roberts. Therefore, Sawchuk was not credited with any rushing attempts.\\nJovantae Barnes continues to operate as the Sooners' clear running back. He made his second consecutive start and played 37 snaps, recording all 18 of the running back carries. Even with Tatum out, the Sooners simply didn't look for any other running backs to run the ball. Sam Franklin and Kalib Hicks never saw the field.\\nBarring any unexpected developments, it's clear that the backfield belongs to Barnes and Tatum.\\n2. Woodi Washington's snaps are going down\\nIf there's been anything noticeable about the Sooners' cornerback room, it's Washington. Specifically, his snaps are only going down. But the Sooners turned to Samuel Omosigho and Bowman to pick up the slack at cheetah.\\nHere are his snap counts over the last four weeks: 50, 46, 40, 34. His 34 snaps against Auburn were a season low, and that came despite Kendel Dolby and Gentry Williams both missing the game. He also didn't start against the Tigers.\\nThe Sooners have been content to use Kani Walker and Dez Malone at cornerback, even as both have had their struggles. Both got burned for long touchdowns against the Tigers, though Malone had a significantly better grade than Walker. Eli Bowen did play 29 snaps, a slight uptick from the 23 he played against Tennessee.\\nIt just hasn't been the best season for Washington thus far.\\n3. Bauer Sharp bounce-back game\\nSharp took full responsibility for his poor showing against Tennessee, where he struggled with blocking and had a costly drop.\\nAccording to the stats, it was a complete 180 for Sharp. He not only led the Sooners in receptions (4 for 43), but he had the highest performance grade on the offense by far. He also had a 70.0 pass-blocking grade a team-best 69.0 run-blocking grade.\\nThe rest of the tight end room was subpar. Jake Roberts accounted for two penalties and Kade McIntyre, who had the lowest PFF grade, had one. On the Sooners' first series of the fourth quarter, Roberts and McIntyre committed costly penalties on back-to-back plays that contributed to a turnover on downs. Neither of them caught a pass.\",\"rights\":\"rivals.com\",\"rank\":10376,\"topic\":\"business\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Beat Writer\",\"media\":\"https://images.rivals.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,t_headline_primary/ymqkkq6mndyd06nxl0gg\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":\"soonerscoop\",\"_score\":null,\"_id\":\"b66e28a889e6bc7ec366626d90c6cb28\"},{\"title\":\"Southwest Airlines Unrecognizable From Former Identity\",\"author\":\"Kyle Stewart\",\"published_date\":\"2024-09-29 14:39:08\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://liveandletsfly.com/southwest-airlines-unrecognizable-from-former-identity\",\"clean_url\":\"liveandletsfly.com\",\"excerpt\":\"Southwest has unveiled more changes and a new international partnership in its pivot from Low Cost Carrier to standard network airline.\",\"summary\":\"My dear readers, some links on this site pay us referral fees for sending business and sales.

Southwest Airlines Former Identity\\nIn 1990s, Southwest moved from a quiet little niche Texas airline to a national powerhouse. The Southwest Effect would lower fares in a new city as the airline expanded by an average of 15% and increased travelers through that airport by 28-30%. The no frills approach was an inferior offering to network carriers at the time who were still offering two checked bags, meals in coach even on short flights, and point-to-point service over congested hub and spoke models.\\nAs the market changed, mostly after September 11th, Southwest stayed the same. What once was a constant compromise for travelers using secondary airports (Manchester, New Hampshire instead of Boston Logan) and forgoing service onboard, became industry-leading with included luggage, one of the most widespread internet install bases, and a cancellation policy that has long allowed travelers to hold onto their value for a future trip.\\nThey were also less expensive, but that's not been the case for more than a decade. Southwest and IcelandAir Partnership\\nSouthwest Airlines and IcelandAir announced a partnership that will take flight in 2025. It will allow Southwest flyers to book and redeem for flights to Europe and for European travelers to reach greater US destinations. Many of Southwest's destinations are already served by IcelandAir in a meaningful way offering greater onward connections. Several of those 14 North American destinations are in focus cities for Southwest's network such as Denver (DEN), Baltimore (BWI), Nashville (BNA), and Orlando (MCO.)\\nThis is not the first time that Southwest has joined forces with a foreign carrier. Southwest's initial partner was when it codeshared with WestJet for some time before ending the airline partnership. It also sought a tie-up with Volaris in 2009 for onward service throughout Mexico.\\nIcelandAir may be different than the others because its customer base has changed. Now, the airline flies into major hubs it fought hard to avoid such as LaGuardia, Dallas/Fort Worth, and Chicago O'Hare. It serves more business flyers than ever before (though they are pulling back some now.) Seating Plan Fully Unveiled\\nIts signature 'sit wherever you want' cattle call has been retired in favor assigned seating. This is, of course, to drive and segment revenue. Assigned seats with access to more space will coincide with more expensive fares, and in time with the ability to buy up just the better seat assignment. Premium seats for now are limited to more space in some coach seats while reducing space throughout the rest of the cabin.\\nWhen Southwest announced the assigned seating plan, some had believed it was solely to expedite seating, reward more frequent customers, or those flying on higher value fares. But it's clear that's not going to be the case.\\nThe airline has, for now, stated it will keep two free checked bags, but like everything else in the march toward improving shareholder value will be subject to investor approval.\\nAll of the moves that the carrier has made are standard network carrier moves because it's facing standard network carrier problems. American, Delta, and United have 952, 947, and 924 aircraft respectively. Southwest comes in fourth at 814, a sizable fleet. For comparison, the next closest carrier is SkyWest (which serves the others on feeder flights) at just less than 500. Alaska comes in at 365 (426 with Hawaiian.) Southwest had 171 million enplaned passengers, ahead of United by 7 million in 2023.\\nJust as the other carriers have found value in segmenting passengers and ancillary revenue, so too is Southwest \\u2013 the last hold out \\u2013 joining the ranks. Who The Carrier Is Now, And What's Next?\\nSouthwest is at a confusing juxtaposition. In order to continue to grow, it's going to need to further segment, offer something below its mostly included model, and add further partnerships. The airline has few destinations in the United States for which it can continue to add meaningful seats and revenue. And as its customer base changes, so too will its partnerships. Past relationships were to serve near field markets on leisure routes. The future is going to be offering something more premium.\\nAlaska demonstrated a model of adding partners across alliances (before it joined oneworld) that helped its customers move around the world on airline partners like Air France, British Airways, and Emirates. While onward connections likely helped Emirates passengers get elsewhere in North America, redemptions were likely the reason that partnership devolved.\\nToday, some Southwest passengers want to go to Paris, London, or Rome and before the IcelandAir partnership, they have to choose other carriers for those destinations. This is the lowest hanging fruit, but is it enough? I'd argue that Southwest customers probably want to go deeper throughout the Caribbean than the handful of destinations the airline offers. Perhaps it's helpful to look outside of airline relationships too like cruise lines, and hotel chains. Hyatt and American have found success in their relationship, Marriott and United have a deal, Delta and SPG pioneered this type of partnership. Maybe Southwest and Hilton will get together. Maybe something a little more unique like Sandals/Beaches resorts as Southwest flies to many of Sandals' resort destinations.\\nAs crazy as it sounds, Southwest may have to consider an alliance membership too. Southwest is large enough to become an anchor for a new alliance and there are likeminded carriers without an alliance that could help Southwest expand its wings, and for global carriers to gain access to more US destinations. Attractive global carriers like Emirates, Etihad, Starlux, and IcelandAir could help to build a broader footprint. As we've seen in recent years, some carriers like SAS, have switched from one to another, that too could happen.\\nWe can't forget the comments that Southwest's Boeing exposure has put the airline in a compromised situation. This could mean new airframes from Airbus. And while we are breaking the aircraft mold Southwest has occupied, we may also want to find some products better suited to its missions, including A220s for longer, narrow markets.\\nThe only thing we know for sure is that Southwest will have to continue to evolve in a way that it hasn't before. It's not the same Southwest it has been and probably shouldn't be thought of as such.\\nWhat do you think?\",\"rights\":\"liveandletsfly.com\",\"rank\":122134,\"topic\":\"business\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Kyle Stewart\",\"media\":\"https://liveandletsfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Southwest-Airlines-Dutch-Roll.jpg\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":null,\"_score\":null,\"_id\":\"15180dc6e751c9297944e8a70e073474\"},{\"title\":\"A prolonged dockworkers' strike could mean products miss peak holiday shopping season\",\"author\":\"Tom Krisher\",\"published_date\":\"2024-09-29 14:38:27\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://fortune.com/2024/09/29/dockworkers-strike-east-coast-retailers-product-delays-holiday-shopping\",\"clean_url\":\"fortune.com\",\"excerpt\":\"A strike could shut down 36 ports from Maine to Texas that handle about half the goods shipped into and out of the United States.\",\"summary\":\"With a dockworkers' strike threatening to close ports on the East and Gulf coasts beginning this week, Chris Butler is growing worried.\\nButler is CEO of the National Tree Company, and, like many businesses, his is counting on shipments that are en route from Asia but won't reach their ports before an expected strike by longshoremen starting at 12:01 a.m. Eastern time Tuesday.\\nThe company, based in New Jersey, is an importer of artificial Christmas trees and other holiday decorations. If a strike were to last just a few days, there might be time afterward to unload the trees, transport them to warehouses and have them ready for customers this season.\\nYet if a strike were to keep ports closed until, say, November, about 150,000 trees might not arrive in time for the peak shopping season, imposing costs on National Tree and other businesses. In a worst-case scenario, those costs, multiplied across industries, could fuel inflation and pressure the U.S. economy.\\n'Definitely not an ideal situation,' Butler said.\\nNational Tree already has stockpiled or delivered most of the roughly 2 million artificial trees it sells each year. But it would lose revenue if 150,000 of the trees got stuck in the pipeline.\\nOther businesses face the same predicament, with goods that could be stranded at sea if 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen's Association make good on their threat to strike. They could shut down 36 ports from Maine to Texas that handle about half the goods shipped into and out of the United States. (West Coast dockworkers belong to a different union and aren't involved in the strike.)\\nA prolonged strike would force companies to pay shippers for the delays, and goods could arrive too late for the high point of holiday shopping season. On Friday, top Biden administration officials met with port operators and told them they should negotiate with the union ahead of Tuesday, according to a White House official who insisted on anonymity to discuss an ongoing meeting.\\nButler says he's hoping for an agreement or for government intervention to halt a strike. But the U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents shippers and ports, and the longshoremen's union haven't met since June. And no talks are scheduled.\\nThe union is demanding significantly higher wages and a total ban on the automation of cranes, gates and moving containers in the loading and unloading of freight.\\nThe Toy Association, the nation's leading toy trade group, was among about 200 organizations that asked President Joe Biden in a letter this month to work with both sides to reach an agreement. The National Grain and Feed Association also urged Biden to take action to avert a strike, which would come just as harvest season gets underway.\\nTheir push has put Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, in a sensitive position: Both have courted union support and don't want to be seen as pressuring the longshoremen to reach a settlement. Yet if an extended strike were to cause shortages of consumer goods or fuel high inflation, it could cost Harris votes in the November election.\\nUnder the Taft-Hartley Act, Biden could seek a court order to suspend the strike for an 80-day cooling-off period. Robyn Patterson, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement that the administration has never invoked the act and isn't considering it now.\\nBiden and Congress did step in two years ago to block a looming freight rail strike and force those workers to accept a deal because of widespread fears that a rail strike would have damaged the economy.\\nAlex Hertel-Fernandez, an associate professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University who served as a Labor Department official under Biden, suggested that the administration will follow the playbook it used in talks last year between West Coast ports and the union there: Mediating negotiations without directly intervening.\\nGreg Ahearn, CEO of the Toy Association, said a strike would happen at a critical moment for toy sellers and makers: Up to 60% of annual sales occur from October through December. Though some toy companies shipped goods earlier, Ahearn said a strike would make it hard to replenish hot-selling items.\\nA strike, he warned, could raise toy prices 'based on scarcity and increased costs.'\\nAt National Tree, Butler and his crew began preparing for a strike in July. They accelerated shipments for everything they could. But one major retail client, he said, asked for trees early. And until recently, factories in China and elsewhere couldn't produce the rest of National Tree's orders.\\nShips containing the trees are on the way to New York but won't get there before Tuesday. A prolonged strike, Butler said, would force most of the trees to be warehoused until next Christmas season.\\nA longshoremen's strike would further distress a global supply chain that has already endured slowdowns from attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels on commercial shipping. Those attacks have all but shut down the use of the Red Sea and Suez Canal, said Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation. The attacks are forcing longer transit times for vessels that must navigate around the Cape of Good Hope to reach East Coast and Gulf Coast ports.\\nA dockworkers' strike, Gold said, could prove even more damaging than the pandemic-induced port congestion in 2021 and 2022, when cargo was allowed to move, albeit slowly.\\nEastern ports could be left at a standstill. Gold noted that carriers are already announcing surcharges on containers to address potential disruptions, a trend that could elevate inflation.\\nMany retailers might find it difficult to charge customers more to make up for those expenses. Most vulnerable, Gold said, would be small businesses that don't import directly and lack the financial resources to incur higher costs.\\nShippers could reroute some cargo to West Coast ports. But those ports couldn't come close to absorbing the additional cargo. The Port of Los Angeles, for example, moved 960,000 containers in August \\u2014 about 80% of its capacity \\u2014 said Gene Seroka, its executive director.\\nThe major Western railroads, Union Pacific and BNSF, have added capacity to their systems to handle more freight as imports have increased. Eastern railroads CSX and Norfolk Southern say they can move cars and crews to handle more freight coming to Chicago from the West. But it's not clear just how much more the railroads can manage.\\nIn any case, Butler said, it would be too costly for him to ship trees across the country by rail.\\nTaylor Green, co-founder of landscaping company Artificial Grass Solutions in Los Angeles, which imports artificial turf, said he bought 25% more turf than usual to ensure there would be enough for clients' projects. He also made arrangements with alternative suppliers in case the strike goes on indefinitely. If it does, Green said, price increases would likely be necessary.\\nStill, like some larger retailers and manufacturers, Artificial Grass says it's better prepared for shortages than it was during the pandemic.\\n'We've learned to be proactive rather than reactive,' Green said.\",\"rights\":\"fortune.com\",\"rank\":329,\"topic\":\"business\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Lindsey Leake,Beth Greenfield,Amanda Gerut,Prarthana Prakash,The Associated Press,Orianna Rosa Royle,David Silberman,Eleanor Pringle,Sasha Rogelberg,Tom Krisher\",\"media\":\"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AP24271631495734-e1727620204597.jpg?resize=1200,600\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":null,\"_score\":null,\"_id\":\"f2884f36fd6d4e6586f353151a223962\"},{\"title\":\"Katie Boulter beaten by Coco Gauff in China Open third round\",\"author\":\"Pa Sport Staff\",\"published_date\":\"2024-09-29 14:37:59\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/uknews/katie-boulter-beaten-by-coco-gauff-at-china-open/ar-AA1rpQ8h\",\"clean_url\":\"msn.com\",\"excerpt\":null,\"summary\":\"Katie Boulter was knocked out of the China Open following a straight-sets defeat to Coco Gauff in the third round.\\nA battling performance saw Boulter test the world number six, but Gauff managed to snatch a tight first set before wrapping up victory in the second to win 7-5 6-2.\\nGauff will now face either Naomi Osaka or Katie Volynets in the last 16.\\nBoulter beat Taylor Townsend to set up a meeting with Gauff and there was little to separate the pair in the early stages, but after breaking Boulter's serve in the sixth game Gauff began to pull ahead.\\nHowever, the British number one battled back and some solid serving helped her recover from 5-2 down to level at 5-5 before Gauff eventually took the first set on her third set point of the 12th game.\\nGauff enjoyed a bright start to the second set and broke Boulter in the fourth game to move ahead before going on to claim victory on her second match point.\\nFrom news to politics, travel to sport, culture to climate \\u2013 The Independent has a host of free newsletters to suit your interests.

Kanye has been trying to sell the mansion for a while, and he just took a substantial loss on it with the amount he sold it for.\\nHere is what Kanye sold his mansion for and how much money he lost on the deal. Kanye Loses Millions By Selling Malibu Mansion\\nKanye West finally sold his Malibu mansion. However, if he thought he could make money off the sale, he was very wrong. Not only did he not make money, but he lost a great deal with the total that he finally got for the house. YouTube/Jimmy Kimmel Live\\nKanye had to drop the price he was asking by almost $15 million when no one made an offer to buy it from him. The biggest problem is there are a lot of problems with the mansion, which is considered to be 'crumbling.' When Kanye bought the mansion in 2021, he paid $57.3 million.\\nAfter he purchased the mansion, he gutted and abandoned it. Kanye later listed it for sale in December 2023. Since then, it has been sitting in escrow. Kanye initially listed the home for $53 million, trying to sell it for a little less than he paid. No one wanted it for that price.\\nFinally, in April, Kanye dropped the asking price to $39 million. According to Jason Oppenheim of the Oppenheim Group, whoever buys it will have to replace all the interior finishes, with Kanye gutted. That will cost millions (via The Hollywood Reporter ). 'On the positive, it can be brought up to 2024 standards \\u2014 it was built about 10 years ago,' he said. Kanye West Faced Lawsuits Based On The Mansion\\nKanye West also faced several legal problems concerning the mansion. The person he hired to gut it sued him for unpaid fees. Contractor Tony Saxon claimed Kanye owed him more than $1 million for his work. Kanye denied the claims in the lawsuit. Kanye West-YouTube\\nIn January, Ron Zambrano, a partner at West Coast Employment Lawyers, filed a mechanics lien on the property on behalf of Saxon. They claimed he owed them more than $1 million and wanted to ensure he had the money to pay them back 'before he goes completely broke.' They said anyone who wanted to buy the mansion would have to go through them first to ensure they were paid.\\nWhile the interiors were gutted, the mansion's exterior is still in great shape, thanks to its concrete work.

Airport Wi-Fi, in particular, is known to be a hacker honeypot, due to what is typically relatively lax security. But even though many people know they should stay away from free Wi-Fi, it proves as irresistible to travelers as it is to hackers, who are now updating an old cybercrime tactic to take advantage.\\nAn arrest in Australia over the summer set off alarm bells in the United States that cybercriminals are finding new ways to profit from what are called \\\"evil twin\\\" attacks. Also classified within a type of cybercrime called \\\"Man in the Middle\\\" attacks, evil twinning occurs when a hacker or hacking group sets up a fake Wi-Fi network, most often in public settings where many users can be expected to connect.\\nIn this instance, an Australian man was charged with conducting a Wi-Fi attack on domestic flights and airports in Perth, Melbourne, and Adelaide. He allegedly set up a fake Wi-Fi network to steal email or social media credentials.\\n\\\"As the general population becomes more accustomed to free Wi-Fi everywhere, you can expect evil twinning attacks to become more common,\\\" said Matt Radolec, vice president of incident response and cloud operations at data security firm Varonis, adding that no one reads the terms and conditions or checks the URLs on free Wi-Fi.\\n\\\"It's almost a game to see how fast you can click \\\"accept\\\" and then 'sign in' or 'connect.' This is the ploy, especially when visiting a new location; a user might not even know what a legitimate site should look like when presented with a fake site,\\\" Radolec said.\\nOne of the dangers of today's twinning attacks is that the technology is much easier to disguise. An evil twin can be a tiny device and can be tucked behind a display in a coffee shop, and the small device can have a significant impact.\\n\\\"A device like this can serve up a compelling copy of a valid login page, which could invite unwary device users to enter their username and password, which would then be collected for future exploitation,\\\" said Cincinnati-based IT consultant Brian Alcorn.\\nThe site doesn't even have to actually log you in. \\\"Once you've entered your information, the deed is done,\\\" Alcorn said, adding that a harried, weary traveler probably would just think the airport Wi-Fi is having issues and not give it another thought.\\nPeople who are not careful with passwords, such as use of pet's names or favorite sports teams as their password for everything, are even more vulnerable to an evil twin attack. Alcorn says for individuals who reuse username and password combinations online, once the credentials are obtained they can be fed into AI, where its power can quickly give cybercriminals the key.\\n\\\"You are susceptible to exploitation by someone with less than $500 in equipment and less skill than you might imagine,\\\" Alcorn said. \\\"The attacker just has to be motivated with basic IT skills.\\\"\\nWhen in public places, experts say it's best to use alternatives to public WiFi networks.\\n\\\"My favorite way to avoid evil twin attacks is to use your phone's mobile hotspot if possible,\\\" said Brian Callahan, Director of the Rensselaer Cybersecurity Collaboratory at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.\\nUsers would be able to spot an attack if through a phone relying on its mobile data and sharing it via a mobile hotspot.\\n\\\"You will know the name of that network since you made it, and you can put a strong password that only you know on it to connect,\\\" Callahan said.\\nIf a hotspot isn't an option, a VPN can also provide some protection, Callahan said, as traffic should be encrypted to and from the VPN.\\n\\\"So even if someone else can see the data, they can't do anything about it,\\\" he said.\\nAt many airports, the responsibility for WiFi is outsourced and the airport itself has little if any involvement in safeguarding it. At Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, for example, Boingo is the Wi-Fi provider.\\n\\\"The airport's IT team does not have access to their systems, nor can we see usage and dashboards,\\\" For said an airport spokesman. \\\"The network is isolated from DAL's systems as it is a separate standalone system with no direct connection to any of the City of Dallas' networks or systems internally.\\\"\\nA spokeswoman for Boingo, which provides service to approximately 60 airports in North America, said it can identify rogue Wi-Fi access points through its network management. \\\"The best way passengers can be protected is by using Passpoint, which uses encryption to automatically connect users to authenticated Wi-Fi for a safe online experience,\\\" she said, adding that Boingo has offered Passpoint since 2012 to enhance Wi-Fi security and eliminate the risk of connecting to malicious hotspots.\\nAlcorn says evil twin attacks are \\\"definitely\\\" occurring with regularity in the United States, it's just rare for someone to get caught because they are such stealth attacks. And sometimes hackers use these attacks as a learning model. \\\"Many evil twin attacks may be experimental by individuals with novice-to-intermediate skills just to see if they can do it and get away with it, even if they don't use the collected information right away,\\\" he said.\\nThe surprise in Australia wasn't the evil twinning attack itself, but the arrest.\\n\\\"This incident isn't unique, but it is unusual that the suspect was arrested,\\\" said Aaron Walton, threat analyst at Expel, a managed services security company. \\\"Generally, airlines are not equipped and prepared to handle or mediate hacking accusations. The typical lack of arrests and punitive action should motivate travelers to exercise caution with their own data, knowing what a tempting and usually unguarded -target it is \\u2014 especially at the airport.\\\"\\nIn the Australian case, according to Australian Federal Police, dozens of people had their credentials stolen.\\nAccording to a press release from the AFP, \\\"When people tried to connect their devices to the free WiFi networks, they were taken to a fake webpage requiring them to sign in using their email or social media logins. Those details were then allegedly saved to the man's devices.\\\"\\nOnce those credentials were harvested, they could be used to extract more information from the victims, including bank account information.\\nFor hackers to be successful, they don't have to dupe everyone. If they can persuade only a handful of people \\u2013 statistically easy to do when thousands of harried and hurried people are milling around an airport \\u2013 they will succeed.\\n\\\"We expect WI-Fi to be everywhere. When you go to a hotel, or an airport, or a coffee shop, or even just out and about, we expect there to be Wi-Fi and often freely available WI-FI,\\\" Callahan said. \\\"After all, what's yet another network name in the long list when you're at an airport? An attacker doesn't need everyone to connect to their evil twin, only some people who go on to put credentials into websites that can be stolen.\\\"\\nThe next time you're at the airport, the only way to be 100% sure you're safe is to bring your own Wi-Fi.\",\"rights\":\"nbcmiami.com\",\"rank\":5043,\"topic\":\"business\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Kevin Williams,CNBC,Kevin Williams Cnbc\",\"media\":\"https://media.nbcmiami.com/2024/09/108039811-1727373915232-gettyimages-1163186026-5104602ra_airport640.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":\"@nbc6\",\"_score\":null,\"_id\":\"76ed5251774111f00c7d14a367e081c5\"},{\"title\":\"Pope Francis suggests Israel's actions in Gaza and Lebanon are disproportionate and immoral\",\"author\":\"Nicole Winfield\",\"published_date\":\"2024-09-29 14:31:05\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.msn.com/en-za/news/other/pope-francis-suggests-israel-s-actions-in-gaza-and-lebanon-are-disproportionate-and-immoral/ar-AA1rpQpY\",\"clean_url\":\"msn.com\",\"excerpt\":null,\"summary\":\"Pope Francis suggested Sunday that Israel's attacks in Gaza and Lebanon have been 'immoral' and disproportionate, saying its military domination has gone beyond the rules of war.\\nFrancis was asked en route home from Belgium about Israel's targeted killing of one of Hezbollah's founding members, Hassan Nasrallah.

Tom Cruise pulled another all-star stunt over the weekend, making a surprise appearance at a screening of Top Gun: Maverick . As if that wasn't cool enough, the showing itself was backed by a live orchestra performing the movie's score.\\nWith nearly 3,000 people in attendance, Tom Cruise's surprise spot was an insanely huge hit within the famed Royal Albert Hall in London. During his introduction, Cruise expressed excitement at the rarity and history that the live music added to Top Gun: Maverick , noting its usage during the silent era.\\nWhile live musical accompaniments to modern films (that's talkies, ya see) have become more popular over the years and it's not uncommon to find them during special occasions (many theaters, for example, do Harry Potter films around Christmas), Cruise said that this particular screening of the Top Gun sequel would allow him to fulfill a lifelong desire. 'I've always wanted to experience a film like this with a live full symphony orchestra, synchronized picture, in front of a packed audience in the grandeur of a classic movie palace. Thank you all for being here, and thank you for making this dream come true.' He even sat at the theater's pipe organ, no doubt taking cues from his old pal Nick Nightingale.\\nCruise, ever the champion of cinema, also expressed his thanks to those behind the scenes of Top Gun: Maverick \\u2013 both the film and the special screening. 'The power of music and its use in cinema to deepen our experience of the story and our connection to the characters is absolutely magical. And the music you're about to hear live tonight, I want to personally thank the extraordinary talents of Harold Faltermeyer, Hans Zimmer, Lady Gaga, OneRepublic, and the gentleman who's here this evening who also produced the score, Lorne Balfe. I also want to thank tonight's orchestra and all of your exceptional talents.'\\nA box office smash at $1.5 billion worldwide and one of the best films of 2022, Top Gun: Maverick was just what both movie theaters and moviegoers needed that year.

Welcome to the 75th edition of your Sunday sports-potpourri notes column, the HB10:\\n1. DOLPHINS: Miami tabs Snoop as top Dogg for Monday night: Quarterback Tyler (Snoop) Huntley will be behind center Monday night as the Dolphins host Tennessee, replacing injured starter Tua Tagovailoa and injured backup Skylar Thompson. The 1-2 Fins have nudged up as from a 1- to a 2-point favorite against the winless Titans. Miami lucks to face a winnable four-game schedule stretch with the Patriots, Colts and Cardinals to follow.\\n2. HURRICANES: Lucky, last-second win in ACC opener the reality check UM needed: No. 7 Miami is a 5-0 team lucky to not be 4-1 after Friday night's 38-34 home escape vs. Virginia Tech in the ACC opener. Official ruled Tech scored the winning pass on a Hail Mary as time expired but the call was controversially overturned on review. Canes had outscored their first four opponents 207-41, and I'd put Friday's scare in the beneficial wakeup call/reality check category with challenging road trips to Cal and then No. 15 Louisville on deck.\\n3. MARLINS: Fish flush season today; Skip out; MLB playoffs on deck: The fire-sale Fish flush another sad season down the commode today at 61-100 entering the finale in Toronto. Miami manager Skip Schumaker is out as expected in a mutual parting. MLB postseason finds Shohei Ohtani's Dodgers the betting fave to win the World Series followed by the Yankees and Phillies. Playoffs open with four wild-card games Tuesday -- with the NL's Braves, Mets and Diamondbacks fighting down to the dramatic last day for the final two WC spots.\\n4. INTER MIAMI: Messi scores for draw; team can clinch Supporters Shield Wednesday: Lionel Messi's goal in the 67th minute Saturday forged a 1-1 home draw with Charlotte and enabled Inter Miami on Wednesday at Columbus to clinch the MLS Supporters Shield for best season record in the league. Miami then finishes at Toronto and home vs. New England before the playoffs begins. Herons are healthy betting favorites to win the franchise's first MLS Cup championship.\\n5. WNBA: Caitlin Clark eliminated; playoffs decide to go on anyway: Rookie sensation Clark's Indiana Fever were eliminated 2-0 in the playoffs' first round as America mourned -- but the postseason, though diminished, bravely carries anyway. It's New York Liberty vs. two-time defending champ Las Vegas Aces and Minnesota Lynx vs. Connecticut Sun in the conference finals starting today/Sunday. As for the Caitlin Effect: WNBA enjoyed its best attendance in 22 years, sellouts were up 242 percent, TV viewership was the best in 24 years, and merch sales spiked by 601%.\\n6. PANTHERS: Stanley Cup champ Cats nine days from NHL opener: The Panthers are 3-2 in the preseason after Saturday's win vs. Carolina, with three practice games left starting Monday vs. Tampa. The champs begin defense of their Stanley Cup for real in nine days, October 8 at home vs. Boston -- the polar opposite of a soft opening. Cats eliminated the Bruins 4-2 in the second round of the '24 playoffs in the most physical test of the postseason.\\n7. TENNIS: Billie Jean King awarded major U.S. honor: For her career on the court and perhaps more so off it, Billie Jean King has received the Congressional Gold Medal -- the first individual woman athlete so honored. President Joe Biden signed the legislation recognizing King's groundbreaking contributions. Now 80, King won 12 Grand Slam single titles and also blazed trails in gender equality, equal pay and women's and LGBTQ rights. A big life well led -- and thankfully still going.\\n8. HEAT: As preseason nears, shade on Miami's new alternate jersey: Every NBA team will introduce new 'City Edition' alternate jerseys this season. The website SB Nation ranked them and the Miami Heat's CE threads are one of five teams graded last in the F-tier with Heat listed at the very bottom. It's a red, sleeveless jersey with 'Heat' in small letters below 'CULTURE' in bigger script. I don't hate it but it is an extra heavy lean on the whole Heat Culture thing, which drives some folks nuts. (Team stages its media day Monday ahead of its preseason opener October 8.)\\n9. GOLF: Company benefiting from Tiger's name sues Tiger in trademark dispute: A company that sells helmet-cooling products for athletes called Tigeraire is suing Tiger Woods' apparel brand Sun Day Red in a trademark dispute, claiming the brand 'unlawfully hijacked' its logo design. (Both designs show a silhouette of a tiger.) Sports word association with the word 'tiger' = Tiger Woods. Dear Tigeraire: Who's ripping off who?\\n10. OLYMPICS: The value of a gold medal to one man in Hungary: Hungarian fencer L\\u00e1szl\\u00f3 Csongr\\u00e1di won gold in men's team sabre at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. This month, his prize was stolen when his home was broken into as he slept. Now 65, Csongr\\u00e1di so badly wants his medal back he has offered, upon his death, to leave it in his will to the thief who stole it if it is returned. 'I want him to return the object that means nothing to him,' he said. The medal would be returned with no such macabre strings attached, if only there was honor among thieves.\\nNEW HB10 FEATURE: THE LIST: 'The List' will bring you something unexpected every Sunday.

The direct routes were originally announced as year-round flights, according to previous Business Journal reports. But both have seemingly switched to seasonal routes, with Aer Lingus and Delta stopping the direct flights by the end of this month, according to flight schedules.\\nAer Lingus' 2024 MSP to Dublin route has been using a widebody A330-200 airplane, which has a two-class configuration of 23 business class and 248 economy class seats. For 2025, the carrier plans to fly the route on a narrowbody Airbus A321XLR with 16 business class and 168 economy cabin seats.\\nAccording to an X post by Thrifty Traveler editor Kyle Potter, Aer Lingus will also increase the frequency of flights.\\nDelta will also continue its direct flight to Dublin, Potter said. Delta's Minneapolis-Dublin flight will continue to operate on a widebody Boeing 767-300 with 28 Delta One seats, 18 Premium Select seats, 21 Comfort Plus seats and 151 economy seats.\\nAer Lingus's flight will resume April 5, 2025, and increase its flights from four times a week to seven times a week. The Irish carrier will also resume its direct flights from Denver, increasing its frequency to six times weekly.\\nThe announcements follow Delta's recent revival of its direct flight to Rome from MSP in the summer of 2025. The Atlanta-based carrier announced it would add four weekly flights from MSP, its second-largest hub, to Rome from late May through late October. Delta briefly flew an MSP-to-Rome direct route in 2016, though it only lasted one summer.\\nDelta could also bring more European routes to MSP in the future.\\nDelta CEO Ed Bastian noted at the Airport Foundation MSP's State of the Airport Event this week that a direct route to Scandinavia could come soon. The Atlanta-based carrier has built a closer relationship with Scandinavian Airlines (known as SAS) after the Copenhagen-based airline switched to the same airline alliance as Delta.\\nJust this week, the two airlines signed a code-sharing agreement effective Sept. 25. The agreement allows Delta customers flying from North America to gain additional access to 50 destinations in Northern Europe beyond SAS's hubs in Copenhagen, Oslo and Stockholm. SAS customers will gain access to more than 150 destinations in North America via Delta's hubs in Atlanta, Boston, Los Angeles, New York and Seattle.\",\"rights\":\"bizjournals.com\",\"rank\":503,\"topic\":\"business\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Cam Bonelli\",\"media\":\"https://media.bizj.us/view/img/12841267/aerlingus-a321neolr-ref122695*1200xx4661-2623-1933-583.jpg\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":\"@mspbjnews\",\"_score\":null,\"_id\":\"03f9cd676e6184545ca6ab76aeadf1a4\"},{\"title\":\"Op-ed: Just like the rest of the nation, America's small businesses are at a crossroads\",\"author\":\"Eric Johnson\",\"published_date\":\"2024-09-29 14:21:25\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/business/money-report/op-ed-just-like-the-rest-of-the-nation-americas-small-businesses-are-at-a-crossroads/5839880\",\"clean_url\":\"nbcnewyork.com\",\"excerpt\":\"As the presidential election nears, small business owners are cautiously optimistic, despite cost concerns, a CNBC|SurveyMonkey study finds.\",\"summary\":\"CNBC and SurveyMonkey's latest quarterly polling of America's small business owners finds a mixed economic outlook, with optimism generated by rate cuts to spur additional spending but concerns about inflation and costs lingering.\\nLast week, the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates for the first time in over four years, signaling a potential uplift for stocks and Wall Street.

The study found that just 32% of American millionaires consider themselves wealthy.\\nWhile the elevated prices of everyday goods and other economic factors may be at play, elements such as your internal beliefs about money can also influence whether or not you feel wealthy no matter how much money you have in the bank, Chaffin says.\\nHere's one reason why that happens and what to focus on instead to feel more satisfied with your money, according to Chaffin.\\nPeople who become millionaires tend to be \\\"money vigilant,\\\" Chaffin says.\\nMoney vigilance is one of the four money scripts coined by financial psychologists Brad and Ted Klontz. People who are money vigilant tend to consistently analyze how much money is coming into and going out of their accounts.\\n\\\"They're very much monitoring their spending and it's been one of their great successes,\\\" Chaffin says. \\\"But the problem is they feel as if they're not really secure yet.\\\"\\nDON'T MISS: How to master your money and grow your wealth\\nMillionaire or not, it's necessary to keep an eye on your spending in order to avoid living above your means.

Otherwise, if you don't change your internal money beliefs, you may still feel anxious about money even if you hit millionaire status.\\n\\\"If somebody says to me, 'When I hit 2.7 million, I'm going to be wealthy,' my next question is, 'Now what?'\\\" he says. \\\"What's going to happen? What's going to happen the next day? How's that going to make your life better? Let's be specific.\\\"\\nIf you're able to cover your necessities daily and have a fully funded emergency fund, chances are you're financially secure. But if you still don't feel satisfied with your financial picture, it may be time to reassess what wealth looks like to you, Chaffin says.\\n\\\"You've got to have enough money to be secure but, at the same time, beyond that you should ask yourself what this money is for and what's the purpose of it,\\\" he says.\\nSetting specific goals for what you hope to accomplish with your money can help you avoid feeling like \\\"enough is never enough,\\\" he says.\\nInstead of simply aiming to be a millionaire, you may set a goal to earn enough money to help your family or so that you can leave your job to travel the world, Chaffin says. Feeling wealthy isn't always tied a specific dollar amount.\\n\\\"Some of the wealthiest people I know have very little money in their bank accounts, but they have a circle around them if anything ever goes wrong,\\\" he says. \\\"That's also wealth.\\\"\\nWant to master your money this fall?

The study found that just 32% of American millionaires consider themselves wealthy.\\nWhile the elevated prices of everyday goods and other economic factors may be at play, elements such as your internal beliefs about money can also influence whether or not you feel wealthy no matter how much money you have in the bank, Chaffin says.\\nHere's one reason why that happens and what to focus on instead to feel more satisfied with your money, according to Chaffin.\\nPeople who become millionaires tend to be \\\"money vigilant,\\\" Chaffin says.\\nMoney vigilance is one of the four money scripts coined by financial psychologists Brad and Ted Klontz. People who are money vigilant tend to consistently analyze how much money is coming into and going out of their accounts.\\n\\\"They're very much monitoring their spending and it's been one of their great successes,\\\" Chaffin says. \\\"But the problem is they feel as if they're not really secure yet.\\\"\\nMillionaire or not, it's necessary to keep an eye on your spending in order to avoid living above your means. But being \\\"hyper-focused\\\" on your spending can skew your perception of your financial state and may lead you to think you aren't as well off as you actually are if you're not careful, he says.\\n\\\"It's no different than somebody who is obsessive about working out and they feel like they're never, ever really in shape,\\\" Chaffin says.\\nWhether you're aiming to save more cash or boost your overall earnings, it's important to ask yourself what you hope to achieve by obtaining more money, Chaffin says. Otherwise, if you don't change your internal money beliefs, you may still feel anxious about money even if you hit millionaire status.\\n\\\"If somebody says to me, 'When I hit 2.7 million, I'm going to be wealthy,' my next question is, 'Now what?'\\\" he says. \\\"What's going to happen? What's going to happen the next day? How's that going to make your life better? Let's be specific.\\\"\\nIf you're able to cover your necessities daily and have a fully funded emergency fund, chances are you're financially secure. But if you still don't feel satisfied with your financial picture, it may be time to reassess what wealth looks like to you, Chaffin says.\\n\\\"You've got to have enough money to be secure but, at the same time, beyond that you should ask yourself what this money is for and what's the purpose of it,\\\" he says.\\nSetting specific goals for what you hope to accomplish with your money can help you avoid feeling like \\\"enough is never enough,\\\" he says.\\nInstead of simply aiming to be a millionaire, you may set a goal to earn enough money to help your family or so that you can leave your job to travel the world, Chaffin says. Feeling wealthy isn't always tied a specific dollar amount.\\n\\\"Some of the wealthiest people I know have very little money in their bank accounts, but they have a circle around them if anything ever goes wrong,\\\" he says. \\\"That's also wealth.\\\"\",\"rights\":\"nbcmiami.com\",\"rank\":5043,\"topic\":\"business\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"CNBC,Cheyenne Devon Cnbc,Cheyenne De Von\",\"media\":\"https://media.nbcmiami.com/2024/09/107240497-1683910694718-gettyimages-1307391886-pi-2139154.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":\"@nbc6\",\"_score\":null,\"_id\":\"ab54d489b025bea1bd9d8e6e4a940b0e\"},{\"title\":\"Op-ed: Your kids need a Roth IRA.

The festival generated more than $1 billion in new commitments to fight extreme poverty, as well as a new partnership with FIFA in which Global Citizen supporters get tickets to matches by taking action on humanitarian issues.\\nThe interview was edited for clarity and length.\\nQ: Can you talk about the Global Citizen Festival's importance?\\nA: We're operating against the backdrop of a world with constant shocks -- the ongoing shock of recovering from the pandemic and now the shocks of global conflicts. That has resulted in the first time in our lifetime where poverty for the last three years has been on the increase. We're talking about 719 million people now living on less than $2.15 a day worldwide. The other big shock that the world hasn't yet fully experienced is the shock of climate change, which has the potential to push another 100 million people into extreme poverty in the next ten years.\\nQ: You asked Global Citizen supporters to write their leaders about fully funding the World Bank's International Development Association. You want them to encourage Colombia to stop providing licenses to companies seeking to drill in the Amazon. And you're hoping to raise $250 million to provide education for 72 million kids currently out of school due to conflict.\\nA: Those are our big pushes this time. We want to address the reality that the world is confronting multiple crises at once.\\nQ: During United Nations General Assembly Week last week, many groups did outreach to Generation Z. Global Citizen has done that for years.\\nA: Based on our most recent data, over 70% of our members are Gen Z. We need to continue to double down on that. It's fueled by the reality that I think we have a model of activism powered through the Global Citizen app that young people can relate to. And it gives them the power of putting activism and advocacy within their own hands. I think that our approach has always been to try to equip young people with the best, most thoughtful policy asks that are backed by incredible research and data and have the ability to have the most profound impact to bring an end to extreme poverty.\\n______\\nAssociated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (Atlas) on August 7, hails from the Arjuna asteroid belt, which is a collection of diverse space rocks orbiting the Sun near Earth.\\nMini-moons have visited Earth before. 2022 NX 1 orbited Earth briefly in 1981 and again in 2022. 2024 PT5 is expected to make a return in 2055, suggesting that Earth's temporary companions often revisit after many

       "  'summary': \"New Delhi: China's PC shipments (including desktops, notebooks and workstations) fell by 6 per cent (year-on-year) to 9.1 million in the April-June quarter as weak demand continued. The country's PC shipments declined by 6 per cent in Q2, with the consumer and commercial sectors falling by 3 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively, as per a Canalys report.\\nAnalyst Emma Xu said that the competitive dynamics of China's PC market are rapidly increasing in complexity. 'Local AI regulations have constrained the full deployment of Microsoft's Copilot in Mainland China. This is pushing vendors toward localised strategies to develop AI PCs, either by integrating in-house AI assistants or by building their own AI application ecosystems through collaboration with developers,' Xu explained.\\nThe forecast anticipates 13 per cent penetration of AI-capable PCs in Greater China in 2024. According to the report, vendors will need to make consistent portfolio investments to execute on their AI PC roadmaps and adapt their go-to-market strategies to be flexible and localised to the unique market requirements.\\nIn contrast, tablet sales increased by 20 per cent to reach 7.8 million units in the April-June quarter, driven by increasing adoption and online promotions. The tablet market is highly competitive, as more smartphone vendors expand their portfolios to include tablets, the report mentioned.\\nAccording to Xu, the AI opportunity is attracting more vendors from the education and Internet sectors into the devices market, driving the development of kids' tablets with educational content in Mainland China. To drive stronger business outcomes, vendors must focus on market expansion and differentiation to enhance user experiences and outcomes. Leveraging on-device AI models will be particularly beneficial in this regard, according to the report.\",\n",

       "  'summary': 'Imagine a cutting-edge venue with the visual impact of a film festival, a museum\\'s sense of wonder and discovery, the multisensory bombardment of performance art and the intellectual challenge of an escape room — all wrapped up in a hyper-immersive story that reveals itself as you walk from room to room. That is Atlas9.\\nThe 46,000-square-foot, $26.7 million entertainment venue is being constructed as part of the Homefield project near 94th Street and State Avenue in Kansas City, Kansas. The project targets a grand opening next summer.\\nexpand\\nIt is the brainchild of Overland Park-based Dimensional Innovations, which built a reputation for creating unique and interesting building spaces and interactive exhibits ranging from the Kansas City Royals Hall of Fame to the Museum at Prairiefire to augmented-reality displays at American Century Investments\\' headquarters. The company teamed up with Swell Spark — operator of Blade & Timber ax-throwing facilities and Breakout KC — to operate Atlas9. Quixotic, the Kanas City-based performance art collective, will add its unique expertise to the project, as well.\\n\\'What we do is create remarkable experiences, and most of the time those are nonfiction stories,\\' Dimensional Innovations CEO Tucker Trotter said. \\'This is an opportunity to create something that\\'s completely based on fiction. We believe people need experiences now more than ever, and we get to create something where they\\'re going to be a part of the story. We don\\'t always get that much flexibility. It puts a tremendous amount of pressure on us, but it\\'s been really fun and fueled a lot of the passions and energy of our internal team. Everyone wants to work on this project because it\\'s so exciting.\\'\\nexpand\\nTrotter said Atlas 9 will draw from everything his organization learned since it was founded in 1993. It will pay homage to the company\\'s roots of helping AMC Theaters build interesting megaplexes and combine years of experience creating cutting-edge interactive exhibits for museums, children\\'s hospitals and professional sports venues.\\nThe company\\'s work, if not its name, has fans nationwide. Sports fans know it for projects like an updated Minnie & Paul Celebration sign and new 12-foot-diameter baseball-shaped sign at the Minnesota Twins\\' Target Field home or the newly iconic Al Davis Memorial Torch in Las Vegas\\' Allegiant Stadium. Children and parents have been positively distracted by decorations and interactive displays at children\\'s hospitals in Kansas City and Columbia and an immersive CreatureVerse at the Connecticut Children\\'s Medical Center. Tourists see the company\\'s handiwork in a life-sized dinosaur bursting out of the side of the Arizona Museum of Natural History and Malala exhibit at the Children\\'s Museum of Indianapolis.\\nHere\\'s a look at Dimensional Innovations\\' diverse portfolio of creations.\\nView Slideshow 13 photos\\nexpand\\nexpand\\nexpand\\nexpand\\nexpand\\nexpand\\nexpand\\nRandall Statler, creative director for Dimensional Innovations, leads the effort on Atlas9. His vision is to create a building full of rooms that each offer a unique experience. Guests can choose which direction to go, and their choices drive the overarching story thread.\\n\\'You\\'re basically walking through this and unpacking this narrative story in a nonlinear way,\\' Statler said. \\'If you take a left, you\\'re going to interpret and digest the narrative in a different way than the person who goes right. So everyone might meet in the middle and have a different tack on where they\\'ve been and where they\\'re going to go.\\'\\nStatler envisions rooms incorporating art, light, sound, moving imagery and performances by Quixotic.\\nSwell Spark CEO Matt Baysinger said the venue leans heavily on Kansas City\\'s artistic community.\\n\"There will be people who show up just because they want to see the incredible art, which is why some people will put this in the museum category,\\' Baysinger said. \\'But we also know that calling it a museum doesn\\'t do justice for what this thing actually is because it\\'s a hyper-immersive activity. All of us at Dimensional Innovations, Quixotic and Swell Spark are experience enthusiasts. This isn\\'t something that you go to, walk around, look at the art and say, \\'That\\'s cool.\\' It\\'s deeper and richer than that because you get to actually experience and interact with the artistic components themselves.\\'\\nexpand\\nBaysinger called Atlas9 one of the most rewarding projects he\\'s worked on in the past decade. He called the people working on it a \\'dream team\\' that considers all ideas, even if they seem impossible.\\n\\'It\\'s been really fun to realize what we are capable of, sometimes in a scary way,\\' Baysinger said. \\'Some of the ideas come out, and I\\'ll scratch my head because the logistics and complications of putting it together seem asinine, and I\\'m thinking there is no way to do it. Then Randall (Statler) comes back after the weekend and says his team figured it out and all the technology works. Quixotic is a big part of it, as well, and we get to work alongside some of the most incredible performers on Earth, who will be woven into the fabric of Atlas9, as well. Folks are going to come into this with expectations that it is small and realize as soon as they step through the door that what we\\'re doing here is big.\\'\\nThe goals for Atlas9 certainly aren\\'t small. It\\'s designers want it to be one of Kansas City\\'s top attractions, right up there with barbecue and the Kansas City Chiefs. They hope it becomes a must-see venue not only for people in the Kansas City area, but worldwide. It\\'s intentionally targeting an opening before Kansas City hosts matches for the 2026 World Cup to give it the best opportunity to make an impression in a global way.\\n\\'We want this to speak to the modernity of the local art scene,\\' Statler said. \\'Kansas City has already been on the trajectory of establishing artistic credibility on a regional and national stage. This is the right time and the right thing to reward that inertia and have it really pay off. It just feels natural and right.\\'',\n",

       "  'summary': 'Indianapolis Colts\\nIt\\'s officially gameday for the Indianapolis Colts (1-2) and Pittsburgh Steelers (3-0), as the hosts look to build momentum and stack a second consecutive win while the Steelers attempt to remain undefeated.\\nThe two teams faced off late last season in a big 30-13 Colts victory, but these two teams are much different this time around.\\nHere is everything you need to know about this Sunday\\'s battle between the Colts and Steelers.\\nDate/Time: Sunday, Sept. 29, at 1:00pm ET\\nWhere: Indianapolis, Ind.; Lucas Oil Stadium\\nTelevision: CBS — Spero Dedes (play-by-play), Adam Archuleta (color), Aditi Kinkhabwala (sideline)\\nTo find out what games will be on in your area on Sunday, check here\\nRadio: WFNI 1070-AM The Fan, WLHK 97.1 HANK FM — Matt Taylor (play-by-play), Rick Venturi (color), Larra Overton (sideline)\\nSteelers lead, 21-7.

After Pittsburgh\\'s last game, Harris was seen in the locker room with a sling over his arm. Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said there would be \"no limitations for Naj\" heading into Week 4. If he isn\\'t fully healthy, the Colts\\' defense needs to take advantage of playing against a worsened rushing attack. Backup running back Jaylen Warren will also miss the game for Pittsburgh, making it an ideal situation for a Colts run defense that had a bounce-back performance last week. On top of running back injuries, the Steelers will be without starting guard Isaac Seumalo. It\\'ll be backups against backups in the trenches on Sunday afternoon.\\nStop Drives in the Red Zone: The Steelers\\' offense has the worst red zone conversion rate in the league, only turning 25% of their trips into touchdowns. Living on field goals isn\\'t sustainable for any team, making it ultra-important that the Colts\\' defense kills drives before they turn into six points. The secondary will play a big part in this, especially when looking at the Pittsburgh receiving corps. George Pickens stands out as the main red zone threat, but no other Steelers receiver is listed as over 6-foot-1. If the Colts can clamp down on a smaller group of pass catchers, it would help take some weight off the expectations of Anthony Richardson and the Indianapolis offense.\\nForce Justin Fields to Throw it Deep: The Steelers are ranked in the bottom 10 of the league in yards per attempt, meaning short passes are the lifeblood of the offense. Forcing Justin Fields to make risky reads would help the Colts\\' defense a lot, especially if he is forced to aim it toward safety Julian Blackmon. In Gus Bradley\\'s defense, that may be a tough ask. Sitting in a zone means the quarterback prefers to find the empty space, which usually isn\\'t deep down the field. Changing up the scheme a little bit could help Colts defenders make big-time plays against a quarterback who\\'s only turned the ball over twice this season. Time of possession has not supported the Colts in the past, so small plays that add up could be poisonous for Indy. Forcing 50-50 balls is a necessity for the defense so they can stay off the field and keep the rock in Richardson\\'s hands.Retractable roof/window stadium (closed).

       "  'summary': \"Here's a look at how the snap counts and performance grades shook out for the Sooners on both sides of the ball.\\nThat victory was improbable in part because of the injuries. The Sooners were without five receivers and Taylor Tatum , while the defense was missing starting cheetah Kendel Dolby . That led to the Sooners playing several depth pieces on both sides of the ball.\\nAUBURN, Alabama — The Sooners somehow escaped with a 27-21 win over Auburn on Saturday, scoring 17 unanswered points to rally late and stun the Tigers.\\n1. Gavin Sawchuk... as the third-down running back?\\nWith Taylor Tatum unavailable, it was expected that Sawchuk would see an increase in snaps. He saw 19 snaps against Auburn, a significant uptick from the seven he saw against Tennessee.\\nHowever, he wasn't really utilized as ball-carrier. The Sooners essentially utilized him as a third-down running back primarily tasked with pass blocking. 13 of his 19 snaps came on passing downs and he ran nine routes, though he wasn't targeted. He's also credited with seven snaps, though those likely came on scrambles from Michael Hawkins.\\nSawchuk only saw one carry and it was his best of the season, as he gashed Auburn for 16 yards. But the play was called back on a hold by Jake Roberts. Therefore, Sawchuk was not credited with any rushing attempts.\\nJovantae Barnes continues to operate as the Sooners' clear running back. He made his second consecutive start and played 37 snaps, recording all 18 of the running back carries. Even with Tatum out, the Sooners simply didn't look for any other running backs to run the ball. Sam Franklin and Kalib Hicks never saw the field.\\nBarring any unexpected developments, it's clear that the backfield belongs to Barnes and Tatum.\\n2. Woodi Washington's snaps are going down\\nIf there's been anything noticeable about the Sooners' cornerback room, it's Washington. Specifically, his snaps are only going down. But the Sooners turned to Samuel Omosigho and Bowman to pick up the slack at cheetah.\\nHere are his snap counts over the last four weeks: 50, 46, 40, 34. His 34 snaps against Auburn were a season low, and that came despite Kendel Dolby and Gentry Williams both missing the game. He also didn't start against the Tigers.\\nThe Sooners have been content to use Kani Walker and Dez Malone at cornerback, even as both have had their struggles. Both got burned for long touchdowns against the Tigers, though Malone had a significantly better grade than Walker. Eli Bowen did play 29 snaps, a slight uptick from the 23 he played against Tennessee.\\nIt just hasn't been the best season for Washington thus far.\\n3. Bauer Sharp bounce-back game\\nSharp took full responsibility for his poor showing against Tennessee, where he struggled with blocking and had a costly drop.\\nAccording to the stats, it was a complete 180 for Sharp. He not only led the Sooners in receptions (4 for 43), but he had the highest performance grade on the offense by far. He also had a 70.0 pass-blocking grade a team-best 69.0 run-blocking grade.\\nThe rest of the tight end room was subpar. Jake Roberts accounted for two penalties and Kade McIntyre, who had the lowest PFF grade, had one. On the Sooners' first series of the fourth quarter, Roberts and McIntyre committed costly penalties on back-to-back plays that contributed to a turnover on downs. Neither of them caught a pass.\",\n",

Both support LiveAndLetsFly.com.\\nIf you haven't followed us on Facebook or Instagram, add us today. Southwest Airlines Former Identity\\nIn 1990s, Southwest moved from a quiet little niche Texas airline to a national powerhouse. The Southwest Effect would lower fares in a new city as the airline expanded by an average of 15% and increased travelers through that airport by 28-30%. The no frills approach was an inferior offering to network carriers at the time who were still offering two checked bags, meals in coach even on short flights, and point-to-point service over congested hub and spoke models.\\nAs the market changed, mostly after September 11th, Southwest stayed the same. What once was a constant compromise for travelers using secondary airports (Manchester, New Hampshire instead of Boston Logan) and forgoing service onboard, became industry-leading with included luggage, one of the most widespread internet install bases, and a cancellation policy that has long allowed travelers to hold onto their value for a future trip.\\nThey were also less expensive, but that's not been the case for more than a decade. Southwest and IcelandAir Partnership\\nSouthwest Airlines and IcelandAir announced a partnership that will take flight in 2025. It will allow Southwest flyers to book and redeem for flights to Europe and for European travelers to reach greater US destinations. Many of Southwest's destinations are already served by IcelandAir in a meaningful way offering greater onward connections. Several of those 14 North American destinations are in focus cities for Southwest's network such as Denver (DEN), Baltimore (BWI), Nashville (BNA), and Orlando (MCO.)\\nThis is not the first time that Southwest has joined forces with a foreign carrier. Southwest's initial partner was when it codeshared with WestJet for some time before ending the airline partnership. It also sought a tie-up with Volaris in 2009 for onward service throughout Mexico.\\nIcelandAir may be different than the others because its customer base has changed. Now, the airline flies into major hubs it fought hard to avoid such as LaGuardia, Dallas/Fort Worth, and Chicago O'Hare. It serves more business flyers than ever before (though they are pulling back some now.) Seating Plan Fully Unveiled\\nIts signature 'sit wherever you want' cattle call has been retired in favor assigned seating. This is, of course, to drive and segment revenue. Assigned seats with access to more space will coincide with more expensive fares, and in time with the ability to buy up just the better seat assignment. Premium seats for now are limited to more space in some coach seats while reducing space throughout the rest of the cabin.\\nWhen Southwest announced the assigned seating plan, some had believed it was solely to expedite seating, reward more frequent customers, or those flying on higher value fares. But it's clear that's not going to be the case.\\nThe airline has, for now, stated it will keep two free checked bags, but like everything else in the march toward improving shareholder value will be subject to investor approval.\\nAll of the moves that the carrier has made are standard network carrier moves because it's facing standard network carrier problems. American, Delta, and United have 952, 947, and 924 aircraft respectively. Southwest comes in fourth at 814, a sizable fleet. For comparison, the next closest carrier is SkyWest (which serves the others on feeder flights) at just less than 500. Alaska comes in at 365 (426 with Hawaiian.) Southwest had 171 million enplaned passengers, ahead of United by 7 million in 2023.\\nJust as the other carriers have found value in segmenting passengers and ancillary revenue, so too is Southwest – the last hold out – joining the ranks. Who The Carrier Is Now, And What's Next?\\nSouthwest is at a confusing juxtaposition. In order to continue to grow, it's going to need to further segment, offer something below its mostly included model, and add further partnerships. The airline has few destinations in the United States for which it can continue to add meaningful seats and revenue. And as its customer base changes, so too will its partnerships. Past relationships were to serve near field markets on leisure routes. The future is going to be offering something more premium.\\nAlaska demonstrated a model of adding partners across alliances (before it joined oneworld) that helped its customers move around the world on airline partners like Air France, British Airways, and Emirates. While onward connections likely helped Emirates passengers get elsewhere in North America, redemptions were likely the reason that partnership devolved.\\nToday, some Southwest passengers want to go to Paris, London, or Rome and before the IcelandAir partnership, they have to choose other carriers for those destinations. This is the lowest hanging fruit, but is it enough? I'd argue that Southwest customers probably want to go deeper throughout the Caribbean than the handful of destinations the airline offers. Perhaps it's helpful to look outside of airline relationships too like cruise lines, and hotel chains. Hyatt and American have found success in their relationship, Marriott and United have a deal, Delta and SPG pioneered this type of partnership. Maybe Southwest and Hilton will get together. Maybe something a little more unique like Sandals/Beaches resorts as Southwest flies to many of Sandals' resort destinations.\\nAs crazy as it sounds, Southwest may have to consider an alliance membership too. Southwest is large enough to become an anchor for a new alliance and there are likeminded carriers without an alliance that could help Southwest expand its wings, and for global carriers to gain access to more US destinations. Attractive global carriers like Emirates, Etihad, Starlux, and IcelandAir could help to build a broader footprint. As we've seen in recent years, some carriers like SAS, have switched from one to another, that too could happen.\\nWe can't forget the comments that Southwest's Boeing exposure has put the airline in a compromised situation. This could mean new airframes from Airbus. And while we are breaking the aircraft mold Southwest has occupied, we may also want to find some products better suited to its missions, including A220s for longer, narrow markets.\\nThe only thing we know for sure is that Southwest will have to continue to evolve in a way that it hasn't before. It's not the same Southwest it has been and probably shouldn't be thought of as such.\\nWhat do you think?\",\n",

       "  'excerpt': 'A strike could shut down 36 ports from Maine to Texas that handle about half the goods shipped into and out of the United States.',\n",
       "  'summary': \"With a dockworkers' strike threatening to close ports on the East and Gulf coasts beginning this week, Chris Butler is growing worried.\\nButler is CEO of the National Tree Company, and, like many businesses, his is counting on shipments that are en route from Asia but won't reach their ports before an expected strike by longshoremen starting at 12:01 a.m. Eastern time Tuesday.\\nThe company, based in New Jersey, is an importer of artificial Christmas trees and other holiday decorations. If a strike were to last just a few days, there might be time afterward to unload the trees, transport them to warehouses and have them ready for customers this season.\\nYet if a strike were to keep ports closed until, say, November, about 150,000 trees might not arrive in time for the peak shopping season, imposing costs on National Tree and other businesses. In a worst-case scenario, those costs, multiplied across industries, could fuel inflation and pressure the U.S. economy.\\n'Definitely not an ideal situation,' Butler said.\\nNational Tree already has stockpiled or delivered most of the roughly 2 million artificial trees it sells each year. But it would lose revenue if 150,000 of the trees got stuck in the pipeline.\\nOther businesses face the same predicament, with goods that could be stranded at sea if 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen's Association make good on their threat to strike. They could shut down 36 ports from Maine to Texas that handle about half the goods shipped into and out of the United States. (West Coast dockworkers belong to a different union and aren't involved in the strike.)\\nA prolonged strike would force companies to pay shippers for the delays, and goods could arrive too late for the high point of holiday shopping season. On Friday, top Biden administration officials met with port operators and told them they should negotiate with the union ahead of Tuesday, according to a White House official who insisted on anonymity to discuss an ongoing meeting.\\nButler says he's hoping for an agreement or for government intervention to halt a strike. But the U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents shippers and ports, and the longshoremen's union haven't met since June. And no talks are scheduled.\\nThe union is demanding significantly higher wages and a total ban on the automation of cranes, gates and moving containers in the loading and unloading of freight.\\nThe Toy Association, the nation's leading toy trade group, was among about 200 organizations that asked President Joe Biden in a letter this month to work with both sides to reach an agreement. The National Grain and Feed Association also urged Biden to take action to avert a strike, which would come just as harvest season gets underway.\\nTheir push has put Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, in a sensitive position: Both have courted union support and don't want to be seen as pressuring the longshoremen to reach a settlement. Yet if an extended strike were to cause shortages of consumer goods or fuel high inflation, it could cost Harris votes in the November election.\\nUnder the Taft-Hartley Act, Biden could seek a court order to suspend the strike for an 80-day cooling-off period. Robyn Patterson, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement that the administration has never invoked the act and isn't considering it now.\\nBiden and Congress did step in two years ago to block a looming freight rail strike and force those workers to accept a deal because of widespread fears that a rail strike would have damaged the economy.\\nAlex Hertel-Fernandez, an associate professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University who served as a Labor Department official under Biden, suggested that the administration will follow the playbook it used in talks last year between West Coast ports and the union there: Mediating negotiations without directly intervening.\\nGreg Ahearn, CEO of the Toy Association, said a strike would happen at a critical moment for toy sellers and makers: Up to 60% of annual sales occur from October through December. Though some toy companies shipped goods earlier, Ahearn said a strike would make it hard to replenish hot-selling items.\\nA strike, he warned, could raise toy prices 'based on scarcity and increased costs.'\\nAt National Tree, Butler and his crew began preparing for a strike in July. They accelerated shipments for everything they could. But one major retail client, he said, asked for trees early. And until recently, factories in China and elsewhere couldn't produce the rest of National Tree's orders.\\nShips containing the trees are on the way to New York but won't get there before Tuesday. A prolonged strike, Butler said, would force most of the trees to be warehoused until next Christmas season.\\nA longshoremen's strike would further distress a global supply chain that has already endured slowdowns from attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels on commercial shipping. Those attacks have all but shut down the use of the Red Sea and Suez Canal, said Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation. The attacks are forcing longer transit times for vessels that must navigate around the Cape of Good Hope to reach East Coast and Gulf Coast ports.\\nA dockworkers' strike, Gold said, could prove even more damaging than the pandemic-induced port congestion in 2021 and 2022, when cargo was allowed to move, albeit slowly.\\nEastern ports could be left at a standstill. Gold noted that carriers are already announcing surcharges on containers to address potential disruptions, a trend that could elevate inflation.\\nMany retailers might find it difficult to charge customers more to make up for those expenses. Most vulnerable, Gold said, would be small businesses that don't import directly and lack the financial resources to incur higher costs.\\nShippers could reroute some cargo to West Coast ports. But those ports couldn't come close to absorbing the additional cargo. The Port of Los Angeles, for example, moved 960,000 containers in August — about 80% of its capacity — said Gene Seroka, its executive director.\\nThe major Western railroads, Union Pacific and BNSF, have added capacity to their systems to handle more freight as imports have increased. Eastern railroads CSX and Norfolk Southern say they can move cars and crews to handle more freight coming to Chicago from the West. But it's not clear just how much more the railroads can manage.\\nIn any case, Butler said, it would be too costly for him to ship trees across the country by rail.\\nTaylor Green, co-founder of landscaping company Artificial Grass Solutions in Los Angeles, which imports artificial turf, said he bought 25% more turf than usual to ensure there would be enough for clients' projects. He also made arrangements with alternative suppliers in case the strike goes on indefinitely. If it does, Green said, price increases would likely be necessary.\\nStill, like some larger retailers and manufacturers, Artificial Grass says it's better prepared for shortages than it was during the pandemic.\\n'We've learned to be proactive rather than reactive,' Green said.\",\n",

       "  'summary': \"Things have not been going great for Kanye West lately. He just suffered massive financial losses thanks to selling his Malibu mansion. Kanye has been trying to sell the mansion for a while, and he just took a substantial loss on it with the amount he sold it for.\\nHere is what Kanye sold his mansion for and how much money he lost on the deal. Kanye Loses Millions By Selling Malibu Mansion\\nKanye West finally sold his Malibu mansion. However, if he thought he could make money off the sale, he was very wrong. Not only did he not make money, but he lost a great deal with the total that he finally got for the house. YouTube/Jimmy Kimmel Live\\nKanye had to drop the price he was asking by almost $15 million when no one made an offer to buy it from him. The biggest problem is there are a lot of problems with the mansion, which is considered to be 'crumbling.' When Kanye bought the mansion in 2021, he paid $57.3 million.\\nAfter he purchased the mansion, he gutted and abandoned it. Kanye later listed it for sale in December 2023. Since then, it has been sitting in escrow. Kanye initially listed the home for $53 million, trying to sell it for a little less than he paid. No one wanted it for that price.\\nFinally, in April, Kanye dropped the asking price to $39 million. According to Jason Oppenheim of the Oppenheim Group, whoever buys it will have to replace all the interior finishes, with Kanye gutted. That will cost millions (via The Hollywood Reporter ). 'On the positive, it can be brought up to 2024 standards — it was built about 10 years ago,' he said. Kanye West Faced Lawsuits Based On The Mansion\\nKanye West also faced several legal problems concerning the mansion. The person he hired to gut it sued him for unpaid fees. Contractor Tony Saxon claimed Kanye owed him more than $1 million for his work. Kanye denied the claims in the lawsuit. Kanye West-YouTube\\nIn January, Ron Zambrano, a partner at West Coast Employment Lawyers, filed a mechanics lien on the property on behalf of Saxon. They claimed he owed them more than $1 million and wanted to ensure he had the money to pay them back 'before he goes completely broke.' They said anyone who wanted to buy the mansion would have to go through them first to ensure they were paid.\\nWhile the interiors were gutted, the mansion's exterior is still in great shape, thanks to its concrete work. It is a 4,000-square-foot house with 1,500 square feet of exterior decks, all with Pacific Ocean views.\\nAre you surprised at how much Kanye West lost in the selling of his Malibu mansion?

Also classified within a type of cybercrime called \"Man in the Middle\" attacks, evil twinning occurs when a hacker or hacking group sets up a fake Wi-Fi network, most often in public settings where many users can be expected to connect.\\nIn this instance, an Australian man was charged with conducting a Wi-Fi attack on domestic flights and airports in Perth, Melbourne, and Adelaide. He allegedly set up a fake Wi-Fi network to steal email or social media credentials.\\n\"As the general population becomes more accustomed to free Wi-Fi everywhere, you can expect evil twinning attacks to become more common,\" said Matt Radolec, vice president of incident response and cloud operations at data security firm Varonis, adding that no one reads the terms and conditions or checks the URLs on free Wi-Fi.\\n\"It\\'s almost a game to see how fast you can click \"accept\" and then \\'sign in\\' or \\'connect.\\' This is the ploy, especially when visiting a new location; a user might not even know what a legitimate site should look like when presented with a fake site,\" Radolec said.\\nOne of the dangers of today\\'s twinning attacks is that the technology is much easier to disguise. An evil twin can be a tiny device and can be tucked behind a display in a coffee shop, and the small device can have a significant impact.\\n\"A device like this can serve up a compelling copy of a valid login page, which could invite unwary device users to enter their username and password, which would then be collected for future exploitation,\" said Cincinnati-based IT consultant Brian Alcorn.\\nThe site doesn\\'t even have to actually log you in. \"Once you\\'ve entered your information, the deed is done,\" Alcorn said, adding that a harried, weary traveler probably would just think the airport Wi-Fi is having issues and not give it another thought.\\nPeople who are not careful with passwords, such as use of pet\\'s names or favorite sports teams as their password for everything, are even more vulnerable to an evil twin attack. Alcorn says for individuals who reuse username and password combinations online, once the credentials are obtained they can be fed into AI, where its power can quickly give cybercriminals the key.\\n\"You are susceptible to exploitation by someone with less than $500 in equipment and less skill than you might imagine,\" Alcorn said. \"The attacker just has to be motivated with basic IT skills.\"\\nWhen in public places, experts say it\\'s best to use alternatives to public WiFi networks.\\n\"My favorite way to avoid evil twin attacks is to use your phone\\'s mobile hotspot if possible,\" said Brian Callahan, Director of the Rensselaer Cybersecurity Collaboratory at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.\\nUsers would be able to spot an attack if through a phone relying on its mobile data and sharing it via a mobile hotspot.\\n\"You will know the name of that network since you made it, and you can put a strong password that only you know on it to connect,\" Callahan said.\\nIf a hotspot isn\\'t an option, a VPN can also provide some protection, Callahan said, as traffic should be encrypted to and from the VPN.\\n\"So even if someone else can see the data, they can\\'t do anything about it,\" he said.\\nAt many airports, the responsibility for WiFi is outsourced and the airport itself has little if any involvement in safeguarding it. At Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, for example, Boingo is the Wi-Fi provider.\\n\"The airport\\'s IT team does not have access to their systems, nor can we see usage and dashboards,\" For said an airport spokesman. \"The network is isolated from DAL\\'s systems as it is a separate standalone system with no direct connection to any of the City of Dallas\\' networks or systems internally.\"\\nA spokeswoman for Boingo, which provides service to approximately 60 airports in North America, said it can identify rogue Wi-Fi access points through its network management. \"The best way passengers can be protected is by using Passpoint, which uses encryption to automatically connect users to authenticated Wi-Fi for a safe online experience,\" she said, adding that Boingo has offered Passpoint since 2012 to enhance Wi-Fi security and eliminate the risk of connecting to malicious hotspots.\\nAlcorn says evil twin attacks are \"definitely\" occurring with regularity in the United States, it\\'s just rare for someone to get caught because they are such stealth attacks. And sometimes hackers use these attacks as a learning model. \"Many evil twin attacks may be experimental by individuals with novice-to-intermediate skills just to see if they can do it and get away with it, even if they don\\'t use the collected information right away,\" he said.\\nThe surprise in Australia wasn\\'t the evil twinning attack itself, but the arrest.\\n\"This incident isn\\'t unique, but it is unusual that the suspect was arrested,\" said Aaron Walton, threat analyst at Expel, a managed services security company. \"Generally, airlines are not equipped and prepared to handle or mediate hacking accusations. The typical lack of arrests and punitive action should motivate travelers to exercise caution with their own data, knowing what a tempting and usually unguarded -target it is — especially at the airport.\"\\nIn the Australian case, according to Australian Federal Police, dozens of people had their credentials stolen.\\nAccording to a press release from the AFP, \"When people tried to connect their devices to the free WiFi networks, they were taken to a fake webpage requiring them to sign in using their email or social media logins. Those details were then allegedly saved to the man\\'s devices.\"\\nOnce those credentials were harvested, they could be used to extract more information from the victims, including bank account information.\\nFor hackers to be successful, they don\\'t have to dupe everyone. If they can persuade only a handful of people – statistically easy to do when thousands of harried and hurried people are milling around an airport – they will succeed.\\n\"We expect WI-Fi to be everywhere. When you go to a hotel, or an airport, or a coffee shop, or even just out and about, we expect there to be Wi-Fi and often freely available WI-FI,\" Callahan said. \"After all, what\\'s yet another network name in the long list when you\\'re at an airport? An attacker doesn\\'t need everyone to connect to their evil twin, only some people who go on to put credentials into websites that can be stolen.\"\\nThe next time you\\'re at the airport, the only way to be 100% sure you\\'re safe is to bring your own Wi-Fi.',\n",

       "  'summary': \"Tom Cruise shocked fans at a recent screening of Top Gun: Maverick, sharing his gratitude for them and the crew.\\nHe feels the need – the need to please! Tom Cruise pulled another all-star stunt over the weekend, making a surprise appearance at a screening of Top Gun: Maverick . As if that wasn't cool enough, the showing itself was backed by a live orchestra performing the movie's score.\\nWith nearly 3,000 people in attendance, Tom Cruise's surprise spot was an insanely huge hit within the famed Royal Albert Hall in London. During his introduction, Cruise expressed excitement at the rarity and history that the live music added to Top Gun: Maverick , noting its usage during the silent era.\\nWhile live musical accompaniments to modern films (that's talkies, ya see) have become more popular over the years and it's not uncommon to find them during special occasions (many theaters, for example, do Harry Potter films around Christmas), Cruise said that this particular screening of the Top Gun sequel would allow him to fulfill a lifelong desire. 'I've always wanted to experience a film like this with a live full symphony orchestra, synchronized picture, in front of a packed audience in the grandeur of a classic movie palace. Thank you all for being here, and thank you for making this dream come true.' He even sat at the theater's pipe organ, no doubt taking cues from his old pal Nick Nightingale.\\nCruise, ever the champion of cinema, also expressed his thanks to those behind the scenes of Top Gun: Maverick – both the film and the special screening. 'The power of music and its use in cinema to deepen our experience of the story and our connection to the characters is absolutely magical. And the music you're about to hear live tonight, I want to personally thank the extraordinary talents of Harold Faltermeyer, Hans Zimmer, Lady Gaga, OneRepublic, and the gentleman who's here this evening who also produced the score, Lorne Balfe. I also want to thank tonight's orchestra and all of your exceptional talents.'\\nA box office smash at $1.5 billion worldwide and one of the best films of 2022, Top Gun: Maverick was just what both movie theaters and moviegoers needed that year. Now, will we see a Top Gun 3 ?\\nHave you ever seen a movie with live music accompaniment? Share your experience with us!\",\n",

       "  'summary': \"GREG COTE'S HOT BUTTON TOP 10 (SEPTEMBER 29): WHAT IN SPORTS HAS GRABBED US THIS WEEK: Our Sunday Hot Button Top 10 notes column brings you what's on our minds, locally and nationally, but from a Miami perspective and accentuating stuff that's big, weird, damnable, funny or otherwise worth needling as the sports week just past pivots to the week ahead. Welcome to the 75th edition of your Sunday sports-potpourri notes column, the HB10:\\n1. DOLPHINS: Miami tabs Snoop as top Dogg for Monday night: Quarterback Tyler (Snoop) Huntley will be behind center Monday night as the Dolphins host Tennessee, replacing injured starter Tua Tagovailoa and injured backup Skylar Thompson. The 1-2 Fins have nudged up as from a 1- to a 2-point favorite against the winless Titans. Miami lucks to face a winnable four-game schedule stretch with the Patriots, Colts and Cardinals to follow.\\n2. HURRICANES: Lucky, last-second win in ACC opener the reality check UM needed: No. 7 Miami is a 5-0 team lucky to not be 4-1 after Friday night's 38-34 home escape vs. Virginia Tech in the ACC opener. Official ruled Tech scored the winning pass on a Hail Mary as time expired but the call was controversially overturned on review. Canes had outscored their first four opponents 207-41, and I'd put Friday's scare in the beneficial wakeup call/reality check category with challenging road trips to Cal and then No. 15 Louisville on deck.\\n3. MARLINS: Fish flush season today; Skip out; MLB playoffs on deck: The fire-sale Fish flush another sad season down the commode today at 61-100 entering the finale in Toronto. Miami manager Skip Schumaker is out as expected in a mutual parting. MLB postseason finds Shohei Ohtani's Dodgers the betting fave to win the World Series followed by the Yankees and Phillies. Playoffs open with four wild-card games Tuesday -- with the NL's Braves, Mets and Diamondbacks fighting down to the dramatic last day for the final two WC spots.\\n4. INTER MIAMI: Messi scores for draw; team can clinch Supporters Shield Wednesday: Lionel Messi's goal in the 67th minute Saturday forged a 1-1 home draw with Charlotte and enabled Inter Miami on Wednesday at Columbus to clinch the MLS Supporters Shield for best season record in the league. Miami then finishes at Toronto and home vs. New England before the playoffs begins. Herons are healthy betting favorites to win the franchise's first MLS Cup championship.\\n5. WNBA: Caitlin Clark eliminated; playoffs decide to go on anyway: Rookie sensation Clark's Indiana Fever were eliminated 2-0 in the playoffs' first round as America mourned -- but the postseason, though diminished, bravely carries anyway. It's New York Liberty vs. two-time defending champ Las Vegas Aces and Minnesota Lynx vs. Connecticut Sun in the conference finals starting today/Sunday. As for the Caitlin Effect: WNBA enjoyed its best attendance in 22 years, sellouts were up 242 percent, TV viewership was the best in 24 years, and merch sales spiked by 601%.\\n6. PANTHERS: Stanley Cup champ Cats nine days from NHL opener: The Panthers are 3-2 in the preseason after Saturday's win vs. Carolina, with three practice games left starting Monday vs. Tampa. The champs begin defense of their Stanley Cup for real in nine days, October 8 at home vs. Boston -- the polar opposite of a soft opening. Cats eliminated the Bruins 4-2 in the second round of the '24 playoffs in the most physical test of the postseason.\\n7. TENNIS: Billie Jean King awarded major U.S. honor: For her career on the court and perhaps more so off it, Billie Jean King has received the Congressional Gold Medal -- the first individual woman athlete so honored. President Joe Biden signed the legislation recognizing King's groundbreaking contributions. Now 80, King won 12 Grand Slam single titles and also blazed trails in gender equality, equal pay and women's and LGBTQ rights. A big life well led -- and thankfully still going.\\n8. HEAT: As preseason nears, shade on Miami's new alternate jersey: Every NBA team will introduce new 'City Edition' alternate jerseys this season. The website SB Nation ranked them and the Miami Heat's CE threads are one of five teams graded last in the F-tier with Heat listed at the very bottom. It's a red, sleeveless jersey with 'Heat' in small letters below 'CULTURE' in bigger script. I don't hate it but it is an extra heavy lean on the whole Heat Culture thing, which drives some folks nuts. (Team stages its media day Monday ahead of its preseason opener October 8.)\\n9. GOLF: Company benefiting from Tiger's name sues Tiger in trademark dispute: A company that sells helmet-cooling products for athletes called Tigeraire is suing Tiger Woods' apparel brand Sun Day Red in a trademark dispute, claiming the brand 'unlawfully hijacked' its logo design. (Both designs show a silhouette of a tiger.) Sports word association with the word 'tiger' = Tiger Woods. Dear Tigeraire: Who's ripping off who?\\n10. OLYMPICS: The value of a gold medal to one man in Hungary: Hungarian fencer László Csongrádi won gold in men's team sabre at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. This month, his prize was stolen when his home was broken into as he slept. Now 65, Csongrádi so badly wants his medal back he has offered, upon his death, to leave it in his will to the thief who stole it if it is returned. 'I want him to return the object that means nothing to him,' he said. The medal would be returned with no such macabre strings attached, if only there was honor among thieves.\\nNEW HB10 FEATURE: THE LIST: 'The List' will bring you something unexpected every Sunday. Our debut:\\nTHE LIST: DOLPHINS QB DURABILITY: Miami quarterbacks who have started every game in a season:\\nNumber of times / Player (Seasons)\\n11 / Dan Marino (1984-86, '88-92, '94, '97-98)\\n4 / Ryan Tannehill (2012-15)\\n2 / Bob Griese (1970, '77)\\n1 each / David Woodley 1982*, Jay Fiedler 2001, Chad Pennington 2008, Tua Tagovailoa 2023. *-Strike-shortened season.\\nOther most recent stuff from me: No. 7 Hurricanes get lucky & get wakeup call in 38-34 win over Virginia Tech // Dolphins have talent to win even with QB mess -- but must plan for life after Tua // NFL Week 4 picks // Are No. 7 Miami Hurricanes really as good as they've looked?

       "  'summary': \"Two airlines have extended their seasonal routes to Dublin from the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, although one will be using a smaller aircraft for the transatlantic flight.\\nBoth Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) and Aer Lingus, which started routes to Dublin in April, will continue the route into 2025. The direct routes were originally announced as year-round flights, according to previous Business Journal reports. But both have seemingly switched to seasonal routes, with Aer Lingus and Delta stopping the direct flights by the end of this month, according to flight schedules.\\nAer Lingus' 2024 MSP to Dublin route has been using a widebody A330-200 airplane, which has a two-class configuration of 23 business class and 248 economy class seats. For 2025, the carrier plans to fly the route on a narrowbody Airbus A321XLR with 16 business class and 168 economy cabin seats.\\nAccording to an X post by Thrifty Traveler editor Kyle Potter, Aer Lingus will also increase the frequency of flights.\\nDelta will also continue its direct flight to Dublin, Potter said. Delta's Minneapolis-Dublin flight will continue to operate on a widebody Boeing 767-300 with 28 Delta One seats, 18 Premium Select seats, 21 Comfort Plus seats and 151 economy seats.\\nAer Lingus's flight will resume April 5, 2025, and increase its flights from four times a week to seven times a week. The Irish carrier will also resume its direct flights from Denver, increasing its frequency to six times weekly.\\nThe announcements follow Delta's recent revival of its direct flight to Rome from MSP in the summer of 2025. The Atlanta-based carrier announced it would add four weekly flights from MSP, its second-largest hub, to Rome from late May through late October. Delta briefly flew an MSP-to-Rome direct route in 2016, though it only lasted one summer.\\nDelta could also bring more European routes to MSP in the future.\\nDelta CEO Ed Bastian noted at the Airport Foundation MSP's State of the Airport Event this week that a direct route to Scandinavia could come soon. The Atlanta-based carrier has built a closer relationship with Scandinavian Airlines (known as SAS) after the Copenhagen-based airline switched to the same airline alliance as Delta.\\nJust this week, the two airlines signed a code-sharing agreement effective Sept. 25. The agreement allows Delta customers flying from North America to gain additional access to 50 destinations in Northern Europe beyond SAS's hubs in Copenhagen, Oslo and Stockholm. SAS customers will gain access to more than 150 destinations in North America via Delta's hubs in Atlanta, Boston, Los Angeles, New York and Seattle.\",\n",

       "  'summary': \"CNBC and SurveyMonkey's latest quarterly polling of America's small business owners finds a mixed economic outlook, with optimism generated by rate cuts to spur additional spending but concerns about inflation and costs lingering.\\nLast week, the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates for the first time in over four years, signaling a potential uplift for stocks and Wall Street. But what does it mean for the backbone of America, our small businesses?\\nA new CNBC|SurveyMonkey study fielded just before the Fed announced its first rate cut, which was anticipated — though the exact size of the cut was not — offers a glimpse into the minds of these entrepreneurs. The quarterly snapshot of Main Street businesses reveals a mixed bag of cautious optimism alongside lingering concerns about inflation and rising costs. With a divisive presidential election on the horizon, the uncertainty is palpable.\\nFour in ten (38%) agreed that inflation continues to be the biggest risk to their business. This is nearly three times higher than the next highest risks, consumer demand (13%) and interest rates (10%).\\nNonetheless, the anticipated interest rate cuts also sparked a surge in confidence.

It spans 262 square metres, with seating for 68 people.\\nKeelan says there are more stores to come. 'We have negotiated another two Melbourne sites and are always looking for more. We believe the City of Melbourne can definitely house two to three more sites in the coming years before we start looking to suburban markets to continue to grow in Victoria.'\\nThe Five Guys schtick is that it doesn't use freezers, while its beef patties are hand-pressed – and its fries, hand-cut – in store daily. But what sets it apart for customers is that they can have it tailor-made.\\nFor a set price, you can add any (or all) of 15 of the toppings – among them raw or grilled onions, HP sauce and fresh jalapeno slices – for no extra charge, allowing for 250,000 variations.\\nFive Guys was established in 1986, before starting to set up franchises in 2003. The master franchisee of Five Guys in Australia is Blue Coral Concepts, which also has Ribs & Burgers, and The Meat and Wine Co through its offshoot entity Seagrass Hospitality.\\nFive Guys QV Melbourne opens at 10.30am on Monday, October 14.

       "  'excerpt': 'Establishing a Roth IRA for kids can set them on the path to financial security. By starting early, they can take advantage of the benefits of tax-free growth.',\n",
       "  'summary': 'As a financial advisor mom of three kids, I know well the power of compounded interest and the value of early work experience and learning to save and invest for yourself.\\nMy kids — ages 15, 12 and 11 — have been tutoring, filing, shredding, sweeping, and even researching and creating infographics for friends and our own companies for a while.\\nThis has not only helped them develop responsible work habits and meet deadlines around their usual school work and extracurricular activities, but it also gives them hands-on experience managing an income. It teaches them at an early age the value of saving for the future and prioritizing important goals such as retirement.\\nFor kids, that seems like eons away. But getting started early can offer tremendous advantages. Then, you might be wondering — like many of my clients do — what\\'s the best way to save for our kids?\\nI believe the answer is for them to save in their very own Roth individual retirement accounts.\\nYes, kids can have their own Roth IRA — and, just like for adults, the IRS rules are pretty straightforward.\\nFor 2024, the total contribution an individual under age 50 can make to any IRA account — whether Roth, traditional or some combination of the two — is $7,000. If someone\\'s earned income is less than that, they can contribute only up to the amount of income that they earned — no \"gift money.\"\\nWhile the child needs to have earned income to qualify for contributions, the money used to fund the Roth IRA can be contributed from someone else. This means the child can keep their earnings for immediate spending, while the Roth IRA is funded separately, helping them build a financial foundation without dipping into their own pockets.\\nParents, grandparents or any generous relative or benefactor can set up a Roth IRA for a child.\\nThere\\'s no minimum age requirement for contributing to a Roth IRA; if a child can earn money, they can have a Roth IRA.\\nBut if the child is a minor — under age 18 in most states but under age 21 in some — a parent or guardian must open a custodial Roth IRA in the child\\'s name and manage the investments until the child reaches the age of majority. Although the custodian makes decisions on the account, the child is the beneficial owner, meaning the funds must be used for their benefit.\\nMore about those income requirements: To contribute to a Roth IRA, the child must have earned income. This income could come from traditional employment, such as a part-time job, or from self-employment activities such as babysitting or lawn mowing. Money received from parents for chores or as an allowance does not count, nor do cash gifts.\\nMost kids, at least the younger ones, are unlikely to earn the $7,000 maximum allowable annual contribution for 2024 and are limited to the total amount they earned during the year.\\nEven if the child is not required to file an income tax return, the parent or other custodian must still keep careful records of the earnings that are used to contribute to the Roth. Self-employment income might be subject to additional taxes such as Medicare and Social Security. It\\'s wise to consult a tax professional to ensure compliance and maximize benefits.\\nI think of the Roth IRA as the \"golden egg\" savings vehicle for young people because not only is the account tax-sheltered, it also has the beneﬁt of liquidity.\\nA Roth can be treated like the long-term savings vehicle it is designed to be, but in case of an emergency, since kids have decades ahead of them before retirement, there are ways to access the contributions without penalties or other drawbacks.\\nEstablishing a Roth IRA for youngsters is a powerful way to set them on the path to financial security. By starting early, they can take full advantage of the benefits of tax-free growth, potentially amassing a significant retirement fund by the time they reach retirement age.\\nThere are other advantages as well. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so withdrawals during retirement can be tax-free, provided certain conditions are met. This is particularly advantageous for children, who are likely in a low or zero tax bracket now, which allows them to grow their investments without the burden of taxes.\\nIn addition, starting early allows the account to benefit from decades of compound interest, significantly growing the balance over time. For instance, if a 15-year-old contributes $2,000 annually until age 65, with an average annual return of 7%, the account could grow to nearly $1 million.\\nUnlike traditional IRAs, contributions to a Roth can be withdrawn at any time without penalties or taxes, and under certain circumstances, even earnings can be withdrawn without penalties for a first-time home purchase, for example.\\nAs another benefit, unlike traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs do not require withdrawals at a certain age, allowing the account to continue growing tax-free for as long as the owner chooses. This gives young people more control over their retirement funds and can be advantageous in managing their retirement income.\\nFurthermore, starting a Roth IRA can help young people learn about investing, saving and financial planning from an early age. The structure of a Roth IRA encourages a long-term outlook on finances, helping young people build a secure financial future.',\n",

       "  'summary': 'October 31, 2024, has been set as the deadline date for all ten franchises of the Indian Premier League (IPL) to finalise their retention for the mega auction for the 2025 season. The IPL teams, using a combination of retention and Right-To-Match option, can retain up to six players from their 2024 squad - comprising a maximum of five capped players (India/overseas) and two uncapped Indians, based on the rules announced by the BCCI on Saturday, following a meeting of the IPL Governing Council in Bengaluru.\\n\"It is at the discretion of the IPL franchise to choose their combination for retentions and RTMs,\" the IPL release said. \\'The six retentions/RTMs can have a maximum of five capped players and a maximum of two uncapped players.\\'\\nIf a player makes his international debut before October 31, he will be considered capped. However, if he is retained by the franchise as an uncapped player, but makes his international debut before the IPL deadline, he will be considered uncapped and the team will only lose INR 4 crore from their purse. The BCCI also announced that the overall purse of all the teams have been increased by 33.34 per cent to INR 120 crore for the auction.\\nThe IPL also revived the \"uncapped player\" rule for the auction, which was discarded in 2021. According to the rule, as explained in the IPL statement released on Saturday, \"a capped Indian player will become uncapped, if the player has in the last five calendar years preceding the year in which the relevant Season is held, not played in the starting XI in International Cricket (Test match, ODI, Twenty20 International) or does not have a Central Contract with BCCI. This will be applicable for Indian Players only.\" The rule will hence allow Chennai Super Kings to retain their former captain MS Dhoni, who last played an international game in the 2019 World Cup and announced his retirement a year later, as an uncapped player.\\nRead more news like this on HindustanTimes.com',\n",

       "  'summary': 'NEW DELHI: A Jammu and Kashmir Police Head Constable, Bashir Ahmed, was killed on Sunday during a fierce encounter with terrorists in the Kathua district. The incident occurred in village Kog, under the jurisdiction of Billawar Police Station, where security forces were conducting a search operation.\\nBashir Ahmed managed to gun down one terrorist before succumbing to his injuries in the exchange of fire. The police confirmed the martyrdom of the officer, describing his actions as a \"supreme sacrifice.\" Two other officers, deputy superintendent of police Sukhbir and Assistant Sub-Inspector Niaz Ahmed, also sustained injuries in the encounter. Both were airlifted for treatment and are reported to be stable.\\nThe encounter began after security forces received intelligence about the presence of three to four terrorists in the remote village. Following the information, a joint operation was launched by the police and security forces. While one terrorist was neutralized, the search for additional suspects is ongoing.\\n\"We were informed about the presence of terrorists in the area, leading to the operation,\" said additional director general of police (ADGP) Anand Jain. \"Unfortunately, Head Constable Bashir Ahmed was martyred, and two others were injured. We are continuing the search and believe the remaining terrorists are foreign operatives.\"\\nThe incident occurred just a day after similar attacks in the same region, raising concerns about security during the upcoming third phase of assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. ADGP Jain assured that arrangements have been made to prevent any disruptions during the elections, stating, \"We are ensuring that no terror attacks or violence take place during the polling.\"\\nThe operation in Kathua remains ongoing as security forces comb the area for any remaining threats.',\n",

(Xinhua/Huang Zongzhi)\\nHANGZHOU, Sept. 29 (Xinhua) -- In the bustling \"Smart Africa\" pavilion at the third Global Digital Trade Expo held in east China\\'s Zhejiang Province, 27-year-old Mafu, wearing a traditional African-style head wrap, was passionately promoting authentic Ethiopian coffee beans via TikTok.\\nHer inspiring performance captured the attention of many curious onlookers. \"I mainly introduce overseas audiences to the origin, unique features and tasting techniques of our products, but most importantly, I highlight the discounts and favorable prices,\" said the young woman from South Africa.\\nAbout four months ago, Mafu arrived in China to study at Hangzhou Vocational & Technical College. This opportunity arose through a one-year talent training program focused on cross-border e-commerce.\\n\"I applied as soon as I saw the admission information online, and was lucky to be accepted. E-commerce has been growing rapidly in South Africa, and I want to learn everything about the industry here in China,\" she said.\\nXie Jijuan, head of the program, noted that over 200 African students have been trained through partnerships with several Chinese colleges and universities, with more than half already engaged in the e-commerce sector.\\nThe cultivation of e-commerce talent is considered a crucial aspect of deepening China-Africa cooperation.\\nSpeaking on African Digital Trade Day, a special event of the expo, Tang Wenhong, assistant minister of commerce, highlighted that China and Africa have conducted fruitful cooperation in e-commerce and other areas in recent years. He also noted how the two sides have established a solid foundation for future collaboration in the digital economy.\\nChinese companies have assisted African countries in constructing and upgrading a 150,000-km communications backbone network, which helps provide internet access for nearly 700 million users. Meanwhile, Chinese companies have also built mobile payment platforms serving tens of millions of African people, according to a white paper titled \"China and Africa in the New Era: A Partnership of Equals.\" © Provided by Xinhua This photo taken on Sept. 25, 2024 shows the China Pavilion at the third Global Digital Trade Expo in Hangzhou, east China\\'s Zhejiang Province. (Xinhua/Huang Zongzhi)\\nMany industry insiders believe that the spread of digital technologies, the ascent of e-commerce and the advancement of digital infrastructure have collectively ushered in unparalleled opportunities for Africa\\'s economic growth.\\nData from Statista, a global data and business intelligence platform, indicates that the African e-commerce industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 24.7 percent over the past seven years, with the industry\\'s annual revenue projected to exceed 42 billion U.S. dollars in 2024, up from just 7.7 billion dollars in 2017.\\nFurthermore, by 2030, at least 88 percent of Africans will own a smartphone, with 4G service adoption reaching 50 percent and that of 5G climbing to 17 percent, according to the latest report by the Global System for Mobile Communications.\\nIn Uganda, digital trade has opened doors for thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises, entrepreneurs and business leaders to access international markets.\\n\"The development of cross-border e-commerce between China and Africa has enabled Ugandan products such as coffee, tea and handicrafts to enter the Chinese market and has created more job opportunities and development space for us,\" said Oliver Wonekha, Uganda\\'s ambassador to China, who believes that digital trade will be a highlight of China-Africa cooperation in the future.\\nSeveral China-Africa cooperation agreements were signed on African Digital Trade Day, including projects for building a China-Africa digital trade platform, a co-creation plan for China-Africa media collaboration and an energy brand export initiative.\\n\"Madagascar is at a critical stage of digital transformation, and we are eager to work closely with Chinese companies to learn from China\\'s advanced experience in the digital economy,\" said Jean Louis Robinson, Madagascar\\'s ambassador to China.\\nHe added that there is enormous potential and space for cooperation between China and Africa, especially in e-commerce, digital infrastructure and technological innovation.\\nThemed \"Digital Trade, Global Access,\" the third Global Digital Trade Expo was held from Sept. 25 to 29 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province. The event is currently China\\'s only digital trade themed expo at the national level. China\\'s digital industry has seen robust growth in recent years, reporting a total revenue of 32.5 trillion yuan (about 4.6 trillion U.S. dollars) in 2023.',\n",

So we have to get our skates on.'\\nThe Associated Press spoke with Evans shortly before Saturday's Global Citizen Festival in New York, am event headlined by superstars like Post Malone and Doja Cat, as well as breakout artists like Benson Boone and Rauw Alejandro. The festival generated more than $1 billion in new commitments to fight extreme poverty, as well as a new partnership with FIFA in which Global Citizen supporters get tickets to matches by taking action on humanitarian issues.\\nThe interview was edited for clarity and length. Q: Can you talk about the Global Citizen Festival's importance?\\nA: We're operating against the backdrop of a world with constant shocks -- the ongoing shock of recovering from the pandemic and now the shocks of global conflicts. That has resulted in the first time in our lifetime where poverty for the last three years has been on the increase. We're talking about 719 million people now living on less than $2.15 a day worldwide. The other big shock that the world hasn't yet fully experienced is the shock of climate change, which has the potential to push another 100 million people into extreme poverty in the next ten years. Q: You asked Global Citizen supporters to write their leaders about fully funding the World Bank's International Development Association. You want them to encourage Colombia to stop providing licenses to companies seeking to drill in the Amazon.

Global Citizen has done that for years.\\nA: Based on our most recent data, over 70% of our members are Gen Z. We need to continue to double down on that. It's fueled by the reality that I think we have a model of activism powered through the Global Citizen app that young people can relate to. And it gives them the power of putting activism and advocacy within their own hands.

       "  'excerpt': 'The CEO of activism organization Global Citizen says the sense of urgency that younger generations bring to solving international challenges needs to be nurtured in the rest of the world.',\n",
       "  'summary': \"NEW YORK – Global Citizen CEO Hugh Evans says the sense of urgency that younger generations bring to solving international challenges needs to be nurtured in the rest of the world.\\n'So many of the world's most prolific movements were started by people when they were young,' Hugh Evans said, noting that Martin Luther King Jr. was only 34 when he delivered his 'I Have a Dream' speech. 'Can you imagine that? (Nelson) Mandela was 26 when he co-founded the ANC Youth League. Malala (Yousafzai) was 11 when she gave her first protest speech. And my hero (William) Wilberforce was 21 when he entered into politics. So we have to get our skates on.'\\nThe Associated Press spoke with Evans shortly before Saturday's Global Citizen Festival in New York, am event headlined by superstars like Post Malone and Doja Cat, as well as breakout artists like Benson Boone and Rauw Alejandro. The festival generated more than $1 billion in new commitments to fight extreme poverty, as well as a new partnership with FIFA in which Global Citizen supporters get tickets to matches by taking action on humanitarian issues.\\nThe interview was edited for clarity and length.\\nQ: Can you talk about the Global Citizen Festival's importance?\\nA: We're operating against the backdrop of a world with constant shocks -- the ongoing shock of recovering from the pandemic and now the shocks of global conflicts. That has resulted in the first time in our lifetime where poverty for the last three years has been on the increase. We're talking about 719 million people now living on less than $2.15 a day worldwide. The other big shock that the world hasn't yet fully experienced is the shock of climate change, which has the potential to push another 100 million people into extreme poverty in the next ten years.\\nQ: You asked Global Citizen supporters to write their leaders about fully funding the World Bank's International Development Association. You want them to encourage Colombia to stop providing licenses to companies seeking to drill in the Amazon. And you're hoping to raise $250 million to provide education for 72 million kids currently out of school due to conflict.\\nA: Those are our big pushes this time. We want to address the reality that the world is confronting multiple crises at once.\\nQ: During United Nations General Assembly Week last week, many groups did outreach to Generation Z. Global Citizen has done that for years.\\nA: Based on our most recent data, over 70% of our members are Gen Z. We need to continue to double down on that. It's fueled by the reality that I think we have a model of activism powered through the Global Citizen app that young people can relate to. And it gives them the power of putting activism and advocacy within their own hands. I think that our approach has always been to try to equip young people with the best, most thoughtful policy asks that are backed by incredible research and data and have the ability to have the most profound impact to bring an end to extreme poverty.\\n______\\nAssociated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

The asteroid, about 33 feet (10 metres) wide, will orbit our planet for roughly two months, from September 29 to November 25, before escaping Earth's gravitational pull.\\nHowever, professional telescopes will be able to capture images of this asteroid as it passes by.\\nAstronomer Jennifer Millard, host of the Awesome Astronomy podcast, told the BBC's Today programme, 'Professional telescopes will be able to pick it up. So, you'll be able to look out for lots of wonderful pictures online of this little dot moving past the stars at great speed.'\\nThe asteroid, which was first spotted by NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (Atlas) on August 7, hails from the Arjuna asteroid belt, which is a collection of diverse space rocks orbiting the Sun near Earth.\\nMini-moons have visited Earth before. 2022 NX 1 orbited Earth briefly in 1981 and again in 2022. 2024 PT5 is expected to make a return in 2055, suggesting that Earth's temporary companions often revisit after many years.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"CNN —\\nGermany has struck a controlled migration deal with Kenya, which will see Berlin open its doors to skilled and semi-skilled Kenyan workers.\\nThe deal was signed by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Kenya's president William Ruto on Friday. Ruto landed in Germany on Friday for an official two-day visit.\\nWhile the exact number of workers that will arrive in Germany has not been disclosed, a spokesperson for Kenya's presidential office previously said it was looking at employment opportunities for up to 250,000 Kenyans.\\nMigration is a major flashpoint in Germany, and has fueled the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Germany welcomed more than one million people during the migrant crisis of 2015-2016 and more recently took in large numbers of Ukrainians fleeing Russia's invasion.\\nThe agreement comes as Scholz's government launches a crackdown on illegal immigration, recently announcing a tightening of border controls. Late last month, Berlin unveiled new security measures aimed at speeding up the deportation of rejected asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants which will begin next week.\\nAs well as deterring irregular migration, the deal is intended to address labor market needs in both countries, providing opportunities for Kenyan workers while supplementing an ageing Gemany's shortage of skilled laborers. It also intends to simplify the repatriation of Kenyans who are in Germany illegally.\\nThe two countries agreed to step up their cooperation on repatriation, with the introduction of measures such as the use of biometric data to identify those who are required to leave Germany.\\nExpired passports and identity cards will now also be accepted as travel documents to facilitate repatriation.\\nAccording to the German government, there are currently around 14,800 Kenyan citizens living in Germany. Around 800 of them are required to leave the country.\\nInterior Minister Nancy Faeser said she was 'very pleased' with the outcome.\\n'We want to consistently enforce the repatriation of people without a right to remain - this is an important building block for limiting irregular migration. We have made good agreements for this,' she said.\\n'On the other hand, we want to attract qualified workers, who we urgently need in many areas of our economy.'\\nThe German Interior Ministry adds that it is in confidential talks with several other countries regarding migration agreements.\\nThe new security package came in the wake of a fatal attack in the western city of Solingen, in which three people were stabbed to death on August 23.\\nThe suspect was identified as a 26-year-old Syrian man with alleged links to ISIS, who had previously been due for deportation.\",\n",

The competition is part of a growing wave of hobby horsing events internationally: the United States and Australia also held their first championships this year.\\nThe events stemmed from a grassroots movement in Finland, where riders trotted their hobby horses through Nordic forests more than 20 years ago. The pastime has since exploded in popularity through social media during the height of the coronavirus pandemic, and it has been credited with highlighting female empowerment for the enthusiasts.\\nAdvertisement\\nArticle continues below this ad\\nJulia Mikkonen, head of the Finnish Hobbyhorse Association, said hobby horsing combines Finnish handcrafting culture — some riders make and decorate their own sticks and stuffed horse heads — with gymnastics and sport.\\nIn Germany, the national hobby horsing association was established a year ago with just 13 members. Now there are more than 5,000 active athletes and more than 200 clubs across the country.\\n\\'It was very important to us to set an example and make the sport more popular,\\' said Kay Schumann, president of the German Hobby Horsing Association. \"With the championship, which will be held every year from now on, we offer a goal that motivates hobby horsers to improve their performance and compete against each other.\"\\nWhile organizers want to promote empowerment and acceptance through a positive and inclusive experience for competitors, critics have pounced on the activity. Many riders have faced bullying and misogynistic comments online. Other detractors say the pursuit is not a sport.\\nAdvertisement\\nArticle continues below this ad\\nMikkonen countered that just like in other sports, hobby horse riders need athleticism, strong core muscles and stamina to succeed.\\nCompetitors in Germany this weekend will be judged on factors including precision, timing and elegance, according to the German Hobby Horsing Association\\'s website. Judges will award marks in the style and dressage contests, and the highest score wins.\\nFor dressage, officials will be looking at the rider\\'s posture, skills and body positioning. Are they using elegant leg movements, with their toes touching the ground first? Are they using various speeds and gaits in their routine?\\nStyle jumpers will also be judged on their posture, as well as jumping over the center of the obstacles, sticking the landing and keeping a steady pace.\\nAdvertisement\\nArticle continues below this ad\\nSchumann said children and young riders brought hobby horsing to Germany through social media. They swapped videos and images with each other, and built a community around the shared interest.\\n\\'It spread like wildfire,\\' he added.\\n__\\nAdvertisement\\nArticle continues below this ad\\nDazio reported from Berlin.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"Karim Adeyemi celebrates the first of two goals against Bundesliga leaders Heidenheim. (Photo by ... [+] Alexandre Simoes/Borussia Dortmund via Getty Images)\\nBorussia Dortmund forward Karim Adeyemi hasn't been called up to the Germany squad since the 2022 World Cup. Indeed, with Germany having regained their former strength under Julian Nagelsmann, it is difficult to imagine Adeyemi being called up any time soon.\\nFor a while, Adeyemi seemed to take this personally. In November, Adeyemi refused a call-up to the U21 Germany national team. According to some reports, this might have been the final nail in the coffin for the Dortmund forward to be left out of the Euro 2024 squad.\\nPart of the story too is that Adeyemi didn't warrant a call-up based on his performances with Dortmund last season. Indeed, Adeyemi managed just six goals and six assists in 24 Bundesliga games for Dortmund this season.\\nThe start to this season, however, indicates that Adeyemi might have taken Nagelsmann's snub ahead of the Euros to heart. Under new head coach Nuri Sahin, Adeyemi is given a more central role, and the forward has accepted a call-up to the U21 Germany team ahead of the European Championship games against Israel and Estonia.\\nIn those two games, Adeyemi was Germany's best player. The 22-year-old scored twice in the 5-1 win over Israel and three times in the 10-1 win against Estonia.\\nMore importantly, Adeyemi then managed to carry over the form to Dortmund. On Friday, the striker was the best player in the Black and Yellow's 4-2 win over league leaders Heidenheim.\\n'I am listening!' Karim Adeyemi (r.) celebrates the second of his two goals for Borussia Dortmund ... [+] against Heidenheim. (Photo by)\\nFirst, the Munich-born forward assisted Donyell for the opening goal (11'), then Adeyemi doubled the lead in the 17th minute. Heidenheim would pull one back in the 39th minute when Marvin Pieringer scored with a header. But Adeyemi restored the balance two minutes later when he made it 3-1 for Dortmund. Both teams would then exchange goals in the second half, but ultimately, Dortmund would carry the day.\\n'We played a good game,' Adeyemi would say to German broadcaster DAZN after the game. 'The two goals against us were unnecessary. But for me personally, I carried the confidence I gained playing at the U21. It is something that really helped me in this game.'\\nAdeyemi then also credited Dortmund head coach Sahin. 'The coach trusted me, and I, in turn, showed him that he can count on me,' Adeyemi said. 'I am very happy about the two goals, and sort of hoped that I could add a third. But ultimately, the three points are more important.'\\nWith seven goals across three games for club and country, Adeyemi is in excellent form. Of course, we have been here before, as Adeyemi has been able to provide flashes of brilliance only to be interrupted by stretches in which he was either out of form or injured.\\nIn fact, conserving this form will be key if Adeyemi wants to make his way back into Nagelsmann's notebook. The Germany senior team has been in excellent form, and Nagelsmann has cultivated a significant amount of depth. Furthermore, Adeyemi isn't the only winger pushing, as Heidenheim's forward Paul Wanner might be an option sooner rather than later for Nagelsmann.\\nIn other words, Germany has the depth now to overlook players who are not at the very top level. Ultimately, that could be good news for Dortmund, as they might finally get to experience the player they hoped they would get when they signed Adeyemi from RB Salzburg for €30 million ($33.2 million) two years ago.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"GÖRLITZ, Germany—When the Cold War ended, European governments slashed their military budgets and spent a windfall of several trillion dollars on social programs—a popular policy with voters when Europe faced few external threats and enjoyed the security protection of the U.S.\\nNow, European nations are finding it difficult to give up those peacetime benefits, even as the war in Ukraine has revived Cold War-era tensions and the U.S. tries to shift its focus to China. Most are failing to get their armies in fighting shape.\\nThe lesson: It was easy to swap guns for butter; reversing the trend is far more challenging.\\nThat means—despite promises to raise military spending—defense ministers say they are struggling to get what they need. In Germany, Europe's largest economy, military bases are crumbling or have been converted to civilian use, including sports centers, old people's homes and pension fund offices. The army, which numbered half a million in West Germany and 300,000 in East Germany during the Cold War, has today just 180,000. It now has a few hundred operational tanks, compared with more than 2,000 Leopard 2 main battle tanks its West German predecessor had in the late 1980s.\\n'That's frustrating to me,' German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius told journalists recently, after getting much less than he had requested for next year's military spending. 'It means there are certain things I can't do at the pace that…the level of threat requires.'\\nIt is also likely to frustrate U.S. hopes that Europe will finally begin relieving some of the burden from Washington, which accounts for two-thirds of military spending among North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies. Both U.S. presidential candidates have said they want Europe to shoulder more of its security costs.\\nIf Donald Trump wins in November, the call for Europe to do so would likely grow louder. Trump said in February the U.S. wouldn't defend allies that don't meet NATO's minimum target of spending 2% of gross domestic product on their militaries, saying Russia could 'do whatever the hell they want' with those that missed the target. In recent days, he said allies should be spending 3%—matching U.S. levels.\\nFew European nations, with the exception of Poland or the Baltic states, are close to spending 3% of GDP on their militaries. The U.K. had vowed, under the previous Conservative government, to raise military spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2030 from about 2.3%. But new Prime Minister Keir Starmer has refused to put a date on it. Military spending in Italy and Spain, meanwhile, sits under 1.5%.\\nAt the current pace of rearmament, it would take Germany 100 years to return its artillery howitzer stockpiles to their 2004 levels, according to a report published earlier this month by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, an independent think tank.\\nDuring negotiations for Germany's 2025 budget earlier this year, Finance Minister Christian Lindner wanted to free up money for defense by freezing social spending for three years—letting it lag inflation. The move was rebuffed by other parties in the governing coalition, and the underlying defense budget was increased by just 1.2 billion euros, equivalent to around $1.3 billion, compared with 2024—just enough to cover the latest pay hike for military personnel. Spending on military aid for Ukraine was cut to €4 billion, about half this year's level.\\nWhat the coalition parties did agree on was a €108-a-year increase over two years in Kindergeld—an annual €3,000 payment per child to all families, regardless of income. Today, that benefit alone, payable for offspring up to age 25, costs more than €50 billion a year, as much as Berlin's annual Defense Ministry budget.\\n'The idea—we are dismantling the welfare state because we need more money for the military—I would find fatal,' said Economic Affairs Minister Robert Habeck.\\nHabeck argued that Germany not only faced an external threat from Russia, but an internal threat from people getting disillusioned with democracy—a jab at the ascendant far-right AfD party.\\n'Social spending is necessary to keep the country together,' said Habeck.\\nIn the mid-1980s, West German military spending stood at around 3% of GDP and over 5% in East Germany. In 2022, the now-unified country spent around 1.4%. As a result, the country saved a total of €680 billion that was put toward rebuilding the formerly communist East and extending the welfare state there, according to Ifo, a Munich think tank. Europe as a whole has saved about €1.8 trillion since 1991 by spending less than 2% of GDP on its armed forces, Ifo calculates.\\nThe meticulously restored town of Görlitz in Germany's far southeast, a setting for Hollywood movies such as 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' and 'Inglourious Basterds,' shows the fruits of the country's peace dividend.\\nIn baroque town squares, pensioners sip flat whites. Students study free of charge at an airy, revamped university campus overlooking the river. The train station is being refurbished, a central square remodeled and the local hospital is building a new wing for the elderly.\\nThe town also shows why politicians are leery of swapping butter for guns, economists' term for the trade-offs states must make when choosing between military and social spending. With an elderly population and weak economy, the city receives the second highest regional transfers of taxpayer money in the form of subsidies and welfare benefits of any German district. Even so, spending pledges by the central government are straining the resources of Görlitz, which shoulders some of the costs, including support for children, said district administrator Stephan Meyer.\\nThe district received a €40 million bailout late last year from the state government to cover a budget deficit. Meyer said he expects the gap between revenues and expenditures to grow to around €100 million by 2028.\\n'Everybody understands that we are at a very special juncture. The question is where will the money come from,' said Christian Mölling, a defense expert and director of the Europe program at the Bertelsmann Foundation in Berlin.\\nDays after Russian President Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz promised a 'Zeitenwende,' or turning point. He pledged Berlin would raise military spending above 2% of GDP, and unveiled a special €100 billion off-budget investment fund for rearmament. Military experts welcomed the move, but warned the 2% threshold wasn't enough to strengthen the military quickly given Germany's chronic underspending.\\nTwo years later, however, Germany's underlying defense budget sits at 1.3% of GDP, and overall military spending is only meeting the 2% threshold thanks to the off-budget investment fund. When that runs out in 2028, Germany will have to hike its underlying defense budget by 60% that year to keep it above 2%—which analysts say is unlikely.\\nNot including the special fund, the share of the underlying defense budget that goes into procuring new weapons and ammunition has fallen from €10 billion in 2022 to €3 billion this year, according to Hans-Peter Bartels, president of the German Society for Security Policy, an armed forces lobby organization. The rest goes mainly to personnel, maintenance, training and building costs.\\n'The Zeitenwende has failed,' said Benjamin Tallis, a senior fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations, calling the effort to rearm Germany 'too little, too slow, too uncertain.'\\nThe country's public social safety net, meanwhile, totaled €1.25 trillion last year, an eye-popping 27% of GDP—higher than Denmark and Sweden and compared with around 23% for the U.S. in 2022, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\\nGovernment officials counter by pointing to the rearmament fund and say strict budget rules mean Germany can't borrow to spend more and cutting welfare risks endangering public support for Ukraine.\\nEconomists say there are many welfare measures that could be pared back to beef up military spending. A heavily subsidized €49-a-month ticket that gives access to public transport and regional trains nationwide costs the state €3 billion a year. Another €5 billion goes for training the unemployed despite an economy that is close to full employment, says Moritz Schularick, president of the Kiel Institute.\\nStates such as Saxony, where Görlitz is located, offer additional perks, such as tens of thousands of dollars in subsidies for families who want to purchase their first home, and subsidized vacations for low-income families.\\nRaising Germany's military spending to 3% of GDP would require finding an extra €40 billion a year, equivalent to France's entire annual defense budget. A study by Mölling and colleagues published this month estimates that plugging the gap in Germany's defenses by 2030 would cost €103 billion.\\n'I'm not sure [cutting welfare spending] is the solution,' said Michael Kretschmer, the conservative governor of Saxony, where Görlitz is located, saying the country needs to spend more on defense, but also on schools, infrastructures, and other items. 'I think what we need is an economy that grows faster.'\\nUpstart political parties, such as the AfD, have been betting that there is little appetite among the public for increasing military spending. The party won the eastern German state of Thuringia and almost won in Saxony state elections on Sept. 1—in part by pledging new benefits such as free school meals, while promising to seek reductions in military spending.\\n'Ukraine and refugees are more important than school food?' said Mike Moncsek, an AfD member of the German Parliament from Saxony.\\nThe new far left BSW party also scored well in the election by promising butter over guns. 'We don't want to prepare for war, we want to prepare for peace,' said Zaklin Nastic, the party's defense policy expert in parliament. 'And above all, we need to preserve social peace here in Germany.'\\nMeanwhile, military projects have faced local opposition. Last summer, not far from Görlitz, hundreds of protesters and local politicians from the far right and far left protested close to a disused air base where Manfred von Richthofen, the World War I flying ace known as the Red Baron, once trained.\\nThe protesters wanted to block the country's leading arms manufacturer, Rheinmetall, from building a new ammunition factory on the site that would supply Ukraine and restock German stockpiles. Many feared the factory could become a target of Russia. Within weeks, the company said it would add capacity to an existing plant in Bavaria instead.\\nNorth of the city lies one of the largest military training grounds in Germany. Görlitz Mayor Octavian Ursu would like to expand the facility, but local politicians are opposing the move.\\n'Residents complain that too much is being done for Ukraine,' Ursu said.\\nWrite to Tom Fairless at tom.fairless@wsj.com and Bertrand Benoit at bertrand.benoit@wsj.com\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'September is a crucial month that could determine if Tesla can claw back recent losses in Europe or whether rivals like BMW can hold onto their gains.',\n",
       "   'summary': \"The research published by JATO Dynamics at the end of last month ought to have hit Elon Musk like a ton of bricks: Tesla is falling behind its competitors in Europe.\\nBMW took the crown as Europe's leading brand for fully electric vehicles for the first time ever in July, driven by demand for its all new iX2 compact crossover. According JATO's figures, the German premium carmaker sold nearly 14,900 cars in the month powered solely by battery, 300 more than Tesla as volumes for the Model Y dropped off steeply.\\nInitial data signaling August hasn't been any kinder to Musk in Europe's largest individual markets. Sales in France fell by half over last year's month, while in Germany they plunged by two-thirds. While the loss of subsidies and new tariffs on Model 3 sedans imported from China contributed to that poor result, industry analysts fear Tesla is now paying the price for pushing a stale portfolio of vehicles into a stagnant European EV market where consumers are spoiled for choice.\\nPwC analyst Steven van Arsdale, himself a Model Y owner, argues Tesla must soon launch new smaller vehicles practical for Europe's cramped spaces and winding, narrow roads. Otherwise they risk losing more ground.\\n'There's some weakness in their armor,' he tells Fortune . 'It's surprising they've done as well as they have, but it will be hard to continue to grow volume without having something in the lower segments.'\\nThe car market is typically divided up into slices based on vehicle size, starting with minicars like the Fiat 500, before graduating to a subcompact like the Renault Clio, the larger Volkswagen Golf compact, the Tesla Model Y mid-size, and so on. These classes usually are referred to as letters, with the 500 starting in the A-segment and the Y as a D-segment, for example.\\n'Europe has traditionally always been really a B and C-segment heavy,' says von Arsdale, 'so the D-segment where Tesla operates is just not the bread and butter of the market.'\\nMatthias Schmidt, a Germany-based EV industry analyst and publisher of a monthly industry report, cautions not to read too much into the figures—at least not yet—since July and August are seasonally among the weakest as people go on holiday.\\nThat's why this month will prove so crucial. Not only are consumers back from vacation, September is traditionally one of the two strongest car sales months in the lucrative UK market thanks to semi-annual plate change that is similar to a new model year designation in the U.S..\\nIf sales don't show a sharp outperformance versus its EV peers this month, it is a clear indication that Tesla has deeper problems in Europe that only fresh new product can solve.\\n'Musk is beginning to realize Tesla needs different models in different segments,' says Schmidt. 'Their range doesn't have a very good spread.'\\nThe EU electric-vehicle market is far deeper and more diverse in its offering than in the U.S., since carmakers on the continent must sell a certain number to avoid draconian fines if they fail to reduce their vehicles' carbon emissions.\\nNext year the EU raises the bar, meaning the continent's carmakers will be more incentivized than ever to try and move their less profitable EVs lest they face steep penalties.\\nIt isn't helping either that Musk is giving his traditional demographic of affluent progressives plenty of cause to eyeball his competitors' offerings. Last month the Tesla CEO egged on UK race riots with divisive and incendiary language and even spread fabricated news on social media that prompted outrage in the country.\\nWhether triggered by his comments or not, Tesla volumes in August plummeted by a full quarter in the UK last month. This time however, Tesla can't blame this on a declining overall market for EVs.\\nUnlike Germany for example, the UK has been a real bright spot in Europe. EV sales in the country recorded their best performance since December 2022, with registrations up 11% over last year's period, accounting for roughly every fourth new vehicle sold.\\nFortunately, some key competitors are leaving the door ajar for Tesla to come back, should it indeed launch new models in Europe in the coming months.\\nVolkswagen Group once challenged Tesla for leadership of the global EV market, but enthusiasm for the technology at its Wolfsburg headquarters has notably waned after a number of products have disappointed. VW is now facing historic job cuts and plant closures.\\n'The transformation is indeed proceeding more slowly than many experts predicted years ago,' VW Group CEO Oliver Blume told German business daily Handelsblatt last week.\\nVolkswagen is not the only one revising its plans. This month, Scandinavian carmaker Volvo scrapped its target to only sell EVs starting in 2030. That means Tesla can expect less EV investment and therefor likely less strenuous competition from legacy brands in Europe.\\nThis leaves the Chinese as the greatest longer-term threats to Tesla in Europe. But surprisingly they are struggling to make inroads.\\nTake Germany, still the largest market for electric vehicles in Europe despite the recent slump. The only Chinese-built electric vehicle of note is the MG4 hatchback with more than 10,000 sold through August. That's no coincidence: The MG badge is a storied UK brand known in Europe with an existing dealer network. Another popular option is Smart, a Mercedes brand that's now operated jointly with new partner Geely, which imports from China.\\nBy comparison, native Chinese brands that lack a legacy distribution network are performing poorly. The BYD Seal, a popular Tesla Model 3 competitor in China, has sold just 400 cars in Germany in the first eight months of this year.\\nPwC Autofact's van Arsdale believes there's plenty of chances for Tesla to claw back market share by offering a smaller vehicle at a cheaper entry price. He cited the substitution of more expensive features and materials for cheaper versions as one possibility, or eliminating them altogether. Tesla already applied this process, known as decontenting, earlier this year in the Mexican market, using cloth fabric on their seats.\\nHe's less convinced, however, that Tesla's Full Self-Driving software, which automates many of the driving functions, could help it gain new buyers if it is indeed approved for use in Europe early next year.\\n'it seems to me they still have a long ways to go to get the system working in Europe,' he says.\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': \"Read here for an analysis of the stake build-up in Commerzbank and UniCredit's distribution policy and highlights on higher costs and litigation concerns.\",\n",
       "   'summary': \"In our last UniCredit (OTCPK:UNCFF, OTCPK:UNCRY) analysis, here at the Lab, we emphasized a clear upside in the M&A. Combined with an attractive capital return and a solid balance sheet, the leading Italian bank was a clear buy opportunity. No sooner said than done, the Group communicated the acquisition of a 9% equity stake in Commerzbank (OTCPK:CRZBF) (OTCPK:CRZBY). 4.51% was acquired on the market, while 4.49% was bought in the accelerated book building launched by the German government for €13.2 per share. Considering a €702 million investment, we positively value this add-on with potential synergies ahead. The operation would be immediately accretive regarding profits projection, with a limited capital impact on UniCredit CET 1 ratio evolution. In addition, the Italian group also submitted a request to the EU regulator to obtain authorization to increase its stake above 9.9% (there is a 30% equity stake threshold for a full takeover). According to the press release, the company is guiding 15 basis points of capital impact with no changes in the current distribution policy. This is due to the company's ample capital buffers, which in Q2 reached 16.2% compared to a regulatory requirement set at a minimum of 7% (4.5% as a percentage of risk-weighted assets +2.5% of capital conservation buffer). This report provides our view on the deal and the latest Commerzbank Q2 update.\\nCommerzbank Deal\\nAs a reminder, UniCredit already has a significant presence in Germany (Fig 1). HypoVereinsBank accounts for 22% of the total company's sales, and there is also a complementary investment banking business. Considering that, the combined entity would rank first in revenues in the German lending market, ahead of Deutsche Bank. According to our calculation, combining the two German businesses would imply approximately €550 billion in assets. The combined budget will also have circa €350 billion in loan book and approximately €400 in deposit, with a market share of 10%. Looking at the details, Commerzbank is bigger than UniCredit German bank (loans of €225 billion vs. €130 billion. The company is also more balanced between retail and corporate; however, it is much less efficient. In detail, Commerzbank has a cost/income ratio of 60% (Fig 3), while UCG Germany stands at < 45%. On an aggregate basis, in a full bid scenario, Germany's weight for UniCredit would rise to 40% from the current level of approximately 20-25%.\\nRunning preliminary numbers for a potential complete acquisition, these are our key takeaways:\\nUniCredit has balance sheet optionality to complete the deal. In our numbers, the company would potentially reach a 13% CET 1 ratio with an ample margin of safety;\\nThe company could generate solid EPS accretion, even with limited synergies. This would exacerbate the Commerzbank stock's attractive valuation angle. The Italian bank's price-to-tangible book ratio now stands around 1.05x, compared to Commerzbank's around 0.5x. Predicting a 20% majority premium, and considering that Commerzbank has a profitability (RoTE of 8%) compared to over 17% for UniCredit, we might expect a potential 15% upside in the current UniCredit EPS estimates.\\nSource: UniCredit Q2 results presentation - Fig 1\\nCommerzbank Q2 results\\nLooking at the Q2 2024 results (Fig 2), the company reported:\\nSales of €2.7 billion, with solid contributions from all the business;\\nOperating result to €2.0 billion in the semester;\\nAnd a CET1 ratio of 14.8%.\\nIn the details, there is a 24% loan loss provision and a 5% increase in Commerzbank's OpEx guidance. Thirdly, there is a pending litigation concern about the mBank CHF mortgage. On the loan volume, there was a 9% decline in consumer lending, which was offset by corporate clients, which delivered a plus 3% on a quarterly basis and a plus 5% on a yearly comparison. The German mortgage business was stable, but there is a continued shift from sight deposits to call money. This might decrease the NII evolution. That said, the company reiterated the Fiscal Year 2024 NII guidance of around €8.1 billion (Fig 3). While volume growth and loan loss provision are temporary concerns, we believe that OpEx outlook and litigation might trigger future profitability and distributions. The company needs to show effective cost control, considering cost and wage inflation. This might result in a pre-tax consensus downgrade. On the downside, the bank booked €240 million for the CHF litigation and confirmed the total litigation provisions below €1.1 billion. The bank CET 1 ratio is vital. Despite the NII decline due to a normalized interest rate environment and a P&L drag from mBank CHF mortgage litigation, we are below the bank's net income projection. That said, before the UniCredit acquisition, the bank was trading at a P/E of 5.7x (2025) with a P/TNAV of 0.5x. This is well below EU bank peers with a P/E of 7x and a P/TNAV between 0.8/1x.\\nSource: Commerzbank's Q2 results presentation - Fig 2\\nFig 3\\nValuation & Risks\\nStarting positively, ECB President Christine Lagarde is open to EU bank consolidation and expresses favorable words. UniCredit trades at a P/E of 6.4x in 2025, with a P/TBV of 0.9x. Here at the Lab, we expect severe scrutiny, which includes Commerzbank's potential stake build-up and a problematic situation in Germany given the difficult juncture of its economic cycle. Even if our initial view of the deal is positive and the company already operates in the country, we have made no changes to our valuation methodology. Our buy is reiterated with a valuation of €38.55 per share. Including a complete merger and valuing the combined entity with UniCredit current multiple might result in a significant upside opportunity (with a target price of almost €52 per share).\\nConclusion\\nHere at the Lab, we are not speculating on an OPA from UniCredit. There are many downsides to consider. That said, the Italian company is still a buy on a standalone basis. In our previous analysis, there was a risk section; today, we include M&A execution risks, changes in taxation, and potential litigation. In addition, a deal with Commerzbank also needs a favor from the German Union.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"At least four people have died, thousands of homes have been damaged and hundreds have been evacuated after some of the heaviest rain in years hit central and eastern Europe.\\nA slow-moving low pressure system dubbed Storm Boris dumped a month's worth of rain onto several of Europe's historic capitals, including Vienna, Bratislava and Prague.\\nFour people have died in Romania, where the rainfall left hundreds stranded in flooded areas. Rescue services have been launched in hard-hit counties as authorities warn that they have recorded the heaviest rainfall in 100 years over the past 24 hours.\\n'The effects were most critical in seven localities,' Romania's Interior Minister Cătălin Predoiu told CNN affiliate Antena 3. 'They have already intervened there to save 95 people. Sadly four people have been found dead in their houses or yards.'\\nRivers burst their banks in Poland and the Czech Republic. In Poland's south, authorities ordered the evacuation of residences in the town of Glucholazy. The level of the river Biala Glicholaska rose by two meters, or 6.5 feet, overnight into Saturday.\\nAfter a difficult night and hundreds of incidents reported Poland's Interior Minister, Tomasz Siemoniak told TVN24 they were 'focusing on what the threats will be in the next few hours.'\\nSignificant flooding is expected to continue in the Czech Republic, where authorities have ordered mandatory evacuations for some areas. Footage released by the Czech Republic Fire and Rescue Service showed flooded streets in the southern Benešově nad Černou municipality, where two women who didn't follow evacuation orders had to be rescued by boat.\\nIn Germany, southern and eastern states in particular are preparing for flooding. Flood warnings have been issued for rivers in the state of Saxony. In neighboring Austria, heavy rainfall has caused water levels to rise in several rivers, leading to rescue services being called out to parts of the country overnight.\\nWidespread and significant flooding is expected to continue through the weekend.\\nRed alerts, the highest level of warning, have been issued for portions of Poland, Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria and Slovakia. This level of alert is associated with 'intense meteorological phenomena' and 'major damage is likely,' according to Meteoalarm.\\nCNN meteorologists Taylor Ward, Allison Chinchar, and Elliana Hebert contributed to this report.\\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\",\n",

The bodies were found in the localities of Pechea, Draguseni, Costache Negri, and Corod, the Department for Emergency Situations said without providing details on how they died.\\nEmergency authorities released video footage that showed a team of rescuers evacuating an elderly man on a small lifeboat before carrying him to safety.\\nA Black Hawk helicopter was deployed to Galati to help with the search and rescue missions.\\nThe storms battered 19 localities in eight counties in Romania, with strong winds downing dozens of trees that damaged cars and blocked roads and traffic. Authorities sent text message alerts to residents to warn them of adverse weather as emergency services rushed to remove floodwaters from homes. Some roads have also been closed.\\nRomania's Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu canceled planned engagements Saturday to travel to Galati county to assess the fallout. 'The Prime Minister will discuss with the local authorities the urgent intervention and support measures for the population and communities severely affected by the floods,' his office said.\\nThe stormy weather comes as several central European nations anticipate severe flooding forecast to hit the Czech Republic, Poland, Austria, Germany, Slovakia, and Hungary over the weekend.\\nMeteorologists say a low-pressure system from northern Italy was predicted to dump much rainfall in most parts of the Czech Republic, including the capital and border regions with Austria and Germany in the south, and Poland in the north.\\n'We have to be ready for worst-case scenarios,' Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said after the government's central crisis committee met. 'A tough weekend is ahead of us.'\\nIn Poland, Prime Minister Donald Tusk also traveled on Friday to the southwestern Polish city of Wrocław where floods are forecast. Authorities appealed to residents to stock up on food and to prepare for power outages by charging power banks.\\nThe weather change arrived following a hot start to September in the region, including in Romania. Scientists have documented Earth's hottest summer, breaking a record set just one year ago.\\n___\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': \"'In football you have to win, that's clear,' Erik ten Hag admitted while the Manchester United manager has defended Matthijs de Ligt's poor form\",\n",
       "   'summary': \"Erik ten Hag accepts that if Manchester United's poor results continue the backing offered by the club's executive will fade, with the manager admitting: 'You have to deliver.'\\nIn their past two games United have lost 2-1 at Brighton and 3-0 to Liverpool. The chief executive, Omar Berrada, and sporting director, Dan Ashworth, supported Ten Hag when speaking before the Liverpool game. 'We think Erik is the right coach for us and we're fully backing him,' Berrada said.\\nIt was put to Ten Hag that this stance may alter if results do not improve. He concurred, stating his contentment with high expectations and that they have a shared vision.\\n'In football you have to win, you have to deliver, that's clear,' he said. 'It's good that the new leadership acknowledges this and says this. We are working together to be more successful – we have higher targets than we've already achieved.'\\nThe Dutchman was asked about his stance that the club remain in transition despite this being his third season in charge. 'It's not only to do with me,' he said. 'Nobody can deny in these last eight or nine months a lot has happened – new leadership team, structure, ownership structure, a new leadership.'\\nTen Hag is under pressure to guide United to victory over Southampton in Saturday's early match but he has no fear that Matthijs de Ligt's poor form for the Netherlands is an issue. De Ligt, bought from Bayern Munich this summer for £38.6m, was taken off at half-time of the 2-2 draw with Germany on Tuesday.\\nThe coach, Ronald Koeman, said this was to 'protect' De Ligt after an erroneous pass allowed Deniz Undav's equaliser and a fluffed clearance led to Joshua Kimmich giving Germany the lead. Three days before, De Ligt made mistakes in the 5-2 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina.\\nTen Hag was asked about Koeman's comment. 'He said it in reference to the Dutch squad, not a club situation,' he said. 'I know Matt and he's a great personality. He will overcome this and will bounce back.\\n'This is definitely not his club situation. I'm not afraid of this situation. The other thing is he had a very difficult pre-season because he didn't play games. The only game from the start was against Liverpool. So he starts for the Dutch squad and is not in rhythm or up to full speed but, when he is, you will see his qualities.'\\nSign up to Football Daily\\nKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football\\nafter newsletter promotion\\nIn the 3-0 loss to Liverpool, Casemiro made two mistakes that led to goals but Ten Hag defended the holding midfielder. 'I speak with him about the situation – everyone can have a bad day at the office,' he said.\\nTen Hag has also discussed with the Brazilian the competition provided by Manuel Ugarte's signing. 'I did [as normal] but players in our club know when you are at this level there is always competition,' he said.\",\n",

A German automotive trade association says they would hurt German automakers, which have a significant presence in China. Germany has a substantial automotive trade surplus with the country. Italian and French automakers, meanwhile, have almost no presence there.\\nChina has been exporting cars to countries all around the globe, and both supporters of tariffs and trade and industry analysts point to China's support for its domestic manufacturers as a rationale for imposing tariffs.\\n'We're dealing with an economy in China where credit money is allocated by the state and not by the market, and the state picks sectors that they want to promote,' said William Reinsch, senior advisor and Scholl Chair in International Business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a bipartisan think tank in Washington, D.C.\\n'In that kind of economy — if you do that — you always get overinvestment, you always get overcapacity, you always get overproduction, and then that overproduction gets dumped on the rest of the world.'\\nChinese automakers can produce a car for about $5,500, said Felipe Muñoz, senior analyst for JATO Dynamics, while it costs European automakers closer to $20,000.\\nThat tremendous cost advantage is partially explained by government subsidies, he said.\\n'But also it's explained by higher economies of scale,' Muñoz continued. 'It's explained by lower labor costs and by the fact that when it's about electric cars, China, unlike the rest of the world, it has already secured the supply chain for the batteries.'\",\n",

They are not traditional activists but have used activism as a tool in the past.\\nWhat's happening\\nVoss has engaged with the company's board and management team regarding ways to maximize shareholder value, including a possible sale of the company in a take-private transaction.\\nBehind the scenes\\nInternational Money Express is a money remittance services provider which enables consumers to send money from the United States, Canada, Spain, Italy and Germany to Mexico, Guatemala and other countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia. The company provides its services through a network of authorized agents located in various unaffiliated retail establishments, 118 company-operated stores and digitally via an app and its website. IMXI serves more than 4 million clients every month and has a goal of connecting families across borders, ensuring financial services are accessible to those who need them most. The company has roughly 20% market share in the top five Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) markets and has been continually seeking expansion into new markets. For example, IMXI has made recent acquisitions of La Nacional in 2022, which has a strong market position in remittances to the Dominican Republic and other LAC countries. The company also acquired I-Transfer in 2023, which established outbound remittances capabilities from Spain, Italy and Germany. It also snapped up a money services entity in the United Kingdom in 2024, which will give the company the opportunity to provide outbound remittances from the UK.\\nThis is not an opportunistic activist engagement for Voss. The firm initially reported holding IMXI in its Q2 2021 13F filing when the company was trading around $15 per share and it has held the stock ever since. Now, on Sept. 5, 2024, Voss filed a 13D and reported 5.64% ownership at an average cost of $19.14 per share, purchasing shares as high as $20.09 in the past 60 days.\\nOne of the things the firm states in its 13D is that it has engaged in communications with the board and management of IMXI regarding a potential sale of the company in a take-private transaction. Voss is not the only actively engaged shareholder in the stock calling for a sale. A day prior to Voss's 13D, Breach Inlet Capital Management sent a public letter to the board of IMXI, urging them to pursue a review of strategic alternatives that includes a potential sale of the company. Breach Inlet asserts that, despite solid operating performance and increasing adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by over 2.5-times since going public six years ago, the company remains undervalued by the public markets. IMXI trades at under 5-times the last 12 months' adjusted EBITDA while its peer remittances service provider MoneyGram was acquired by private equity firm Madison Dearborn for approximately 8-times adjusted EBITDA last June. Breach Inlet thinks that IMXI should be valued at a premium to MoneyGram, not a material discount, but just an equal valuation would imply a roughly $30 per share price.\\nGlobal remittances service provision is a highly fragmented market with no single company commanding greater than 20% market share. Accordingly, there could be consolidation opportunities for IMXI with a strategic acquirer like Western Union, which also trades at a premium to IMXI. If IMXI stays independent, its growth plan of expansion into the digital and European markets would require heavy investment in people and resources, sacrificing short-term performance for long term growth. This is not the type of plan that plays well in the public markets. Instead, IMXI could be a great business to be acquired by a private equity firm that can help facilitate the company's growth plan while shielding it from the public markets, which have failed to fully value the company. You do not need to be a genius to see the allure of a company like this to private equity: A private equity firm bought it in 2007 and another one again in 2017.\\nThis is not the first time Voss is advocating for a strategic review at a portfolio company. In its 13D on Benefytt Technologies, filed in December 2019 when the stock was trading at roughly $14 per share, Voss highlighted the strategic opportunities at Benefytt and the active M&A environment in the company's space. Benefytt was acquired by Madison Dearborn Partners on Aug. 31, 2020 for $31 per share. Most recently, at Griffon, Voss called for a strategic review, which the company undertook and ultimately concluded, determining to stay independent. Despite this, Griffon was a highly successful activist campaign for Voss where the firm gained board seats and made a 139.21% return on its 13D versus 1.28% for the Russell 2000 over the same period.\\nWe strongly believe that modern day shareholder activism is a strategy that greatly benefits shareholders. We believe the best type of shareholder activism involves activists who come in with a detailed, long-term plan to create value, with a board seat being a huge plus. The other side of the spectrum is shorter-term 'sell the company' activism that is often great for the investor but shortchanges the long-term shareholder. In those situations, we like to see a longer-term 'Plan A' with a sale as a last resort or a detailed analysis on why the company cannot or should not continue as a standalone public company. While Voss does not provide either of these, the firm does have a lot of credibility as a long-term investor (an owner since 2021) who has not been public with its recommendations to management until now. As such, we think Voss's intentions here are honorable and it's doing what it thinks is best for both short-term and long-term shareholders.\\nIf the IMXI does not execute on a strategic plan, Voss will likely consider director nominations. While a proxy fight is not likely part of its current plan, the firm has been successful in gaining board representation in previous campaigns. Voss is not afraid to take a proxy fight to a vote. At Griffon, the firm ran a successful proxy fight, winning a board seat for one of its two director nominees at the 2022 annual meeting, and later settling for another board seat. There are two directors up for election at the 2025 annual meeting and the nomination window opens on Feb. 21, 2025. If it comes to a proxy fight there are multiple factors that could work in Voss's favor, including the company's depressed stock price. There have also been signs of shareholder discontent, including the roughly 31% withhold votes cast against lead independent director Michael Purcell at the 2024 annual meeting\\nKen Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments.\",\n",

The heavy rainfall continued to pummel the region into Sunday.\\nIn Poland on Sunday, one person drowned in Klodzko county and authorities advised residents of Moszczanka and Laka Prudnicka to evacuate after a dam at risk of collapse breached. In Austria the same day, a firefighter died in action, the fire department told CNN.\\nIn Romania, two more people were confirmed to have died from flooding on Sunday, following four deaths on Saturday.\\nRescuers have been working hard to rescue hundreds of people left stranded by heavy rainfall there. 'The effects were most critical in seven localities,' Romania's Interior Minister Cătălin Predoiu told Antena 3. Although teams managed to save 95 people trapped in their homes, the bodies of the dead were found in either their houses or yards, Predoiu added.\\nAround 5,400 houses have been damaged in the southeastern region of Galati which has been hardest hit by the flooding, Antena 3 reported.\\nResidents in one of the region's villages, Pechea, recounted their shock at the devastation wrought by the flooding. 'I have nothing left,' social worker Sofia Basalic told AFP, describing how the gushes of water had 'entered the house' and 'tore down the walls,' destroying her kitchen appliances and killing her farm animals.\\nFactory worker Gica Stan, whose entire house was also flooded, said he didn't even have a 'needle left' and was now relying on donated clothes.\\nRescue services have been launched in hard-hit counties as authorities warn that they have recorded the heaviest rainfall in 100 years over the past 24 hours.\\nRivers have burst their banks in Poland and the Czech Republic. In southwest Poland, 1,600 people were evacuated in Klodzko county as local rivers reached record high water levels and broke their banks.

       "   'excerpt': 'The Shenzhen A shares index, a bellwether of mainland Chinese equities, is down 32 percent from its 2-year high set in February of last year.',\n",
       "   'summary': \"da-kuk\\nDemography, deflation and debt. These are the Three Ds of China's economic lassitude, and they have all been in the news recently. International investors, meanwhile, continue to add a fourth D to the picture - departure. The Shenzhen A shares index, a bellwether of mainland Chinese equities, is down 32 percent from its 2-year high set in February of last year. And it's not just portfolio managers with their fleet-of-foot capital heading for the exits; US and European businesses with longstanding foreign direct investment in China are rethinking the dependence of their supply chains on a China that has become increasingly difficult to deal with, both economically and politically.\\nWhere Have All The Workers Gone\\nChina's demographic problems begin and end with its dependency ratio - the number of retirees relative to the working population. That number has been going up as the population ages and the birth rate, even after the end of the disastrous one child per family experiment, declines. Economists project that China will add around 20 million people to its retirement rolls each year from 2023 to 2035, straining its badly underfunded pension system. This week, the government announced its intention to raise the official retirement age for the first time since 1978, gradually extending the age for men from 60 to 63, for women in white-collar jobs from 55 to 58, and for women in blue-collar fields from 55 to 58.\\nThe Japan Syndrome\\nNo amount of tinkering with the retirement age will help China deal with a deep consumer funk that threatens its growth prospects as far ahead as the eye can see. Consumer prices are teetering on the edge of outright deflation - China's consumer price index currently sits at just 0.6 percent year-on-year, compared to the 2.5 percent headline CPI number for the US released earlier this week. Households have cut back on spending as the country's property crisis grows deeper and deeper, with little in the way of economic assistance from Beijing. China's household savings rate is an astonishing 31 percent. When the government does step in, it does so in an oblique way by pumping liquidity into the manufacturing sector, apparently in the hope that industrial production will boost exports and thus circulate money back into the domestic economy. A news article in the Financial Times this week cited a handful of economists arguing that under current conditions, China would need to spend some $1.4 trillion in stimulus outlays to put the country back on a long-term sustainable growth trend.\\nBond Bubble\\nWhen economic growth prospects look shaky, investors seek safety in fixed income markets, and China is no exception. Massive purchases of government bonds have driven the yield on the 10-year benchmark bond down to an all-time low of 2.1 percent. Banks and nonbank financial institutions have been leading the charge, giving rise to fears of a bond bubble that could decimate banks' asset quality if rates were to suddenly spike up. As they could well do, given that the total amount of new government borrowing between August and December of this year is estimated to be close to $400 billion. Xi Jinping's long-term economic strategy calls for substantial investment - meaning lots and lots of debt issuance - in leading-edge green technology to establish global dominance in what Beijing expects to be the growth drivers of the coming decades. The success of that long-term vision is anything but certain; meanwhile, the already-precarious state of the Chinese economy could unravel further still with a widespread debt crisis.\\nChina is the world's second-largest economy - in fact, it is the largest when ranked by purchasing power parity. The Chinese supercycle, which lasted from the early 1990s through the first decade of the 21st century, is the fastest growth cycle ever recorded in human history. Thus, its current economic troubles reach far beyond the shores of mainland China. The country's weakness is a key factor, for example, in the economic travails of Germany, whose usually reliable exports of high-value manufactured products languish amid weak demand from China, its biggest market (and these conditions, in turn, explain a good part of Germany's current political troubles with extreme right wing and left wing political parties winning three recently-held regional contests in the county's east).\\nMeanwhile, even with its diminished domestic equity markets, China still makes up around 25 percent of the MSCI Emerging Markets equity index. One way to understand the chronic underperformance of emerging market equities, as we have noted in commentaries over the past several years, is to understand the 3D problem of China - demography, deflation and debt - that does not appear to be going away any time soon.\\nOriginal Post\\nEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"European countries are facing challenges in competing in global markets. Former Italian Prime Minister and former ECB President Mario Draghi proposed a recovery plan that wasn't well-received by everyone.\\nIn the report, or rather in two reports by Mario Draghi, structural problems of the European Union and its member states in terms of global competition, especially with China and the USA, were highlighted. Among the issues noted were decreasing productivity, low innovation, a shortage of skilled workers, high energy prices combined with the costs of the energy transition, and the spread of unfair competition in international trade. The proposed solution was to increase investments by approximately 800 billion euros ($886 billion dollars) annually, which is about 5 percent of the EU GDP. By comparison, investments under the Marshall Plan were about 2 percent of GDP. The report also noted issues with defense and the arms industry.\\nDraghi pointed out two worrying trends. First, EU countries are keen to procure weapons and their components from outside the Community, limiting the development of the EU economy. At the same time, they are reluctant to invest in joint (and often their own) projects, weakening local R&D potential and leading to its dispersion. For example, during the period of increased defense purchases in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine (from mid-2022 to mid-2023), 63 percent of the value of defense orders were placed with the American industry and 15 percent with non-American companies outside the EU.\\nIn a similar period, EU countries allocated only 5 percent of their defense spending to R&D activities (about $11.8 billion), while in the USA, 16 percent of defense spending went to this purpose ($140 billion, several times more). The crisis is exacerbated by the fact that many countries are still avoiding meeting NATO's requirement of allocating 2 percent of GDP to defense (by the end of 2023, 9 out of 32 NATO countries had not met this requirement, most of which are EU members). Achieving this requirement by all EU countries would result in an increase in EU defense spending by about $66 billion.\\nThe report emphasized that the dispersion of organizational efforts deepens production fragmentation. For example, 10 different types of 155 mm caliber guns were sent to Ukraine, not all of which use the same ammunition. The arms industry is also said to be over-regulated, similar to many other sectors.\\nAs a remedy to this unfavorable situation, the author recommended increasing investments in R&D activities, the defense industry (within the framework of the aforementioned increased investment expenditures), and supporting European industrial integration. Draghi also proposed broader usage of the joint defense procurement mechanism and the creation of a separate position for a commissioner for the defense industry.\\nAccording to Draghi, public procurement regulations should be revised to favor EU solutions. When purchasing solutions outside the USA, a model should be sought in which many EU countries would purchase jointly to obtain better conditions, including moving production to the EU and ensuring technical support.\\nDraghi's plan as a whole is opposed by Germany, among others, who are reluctant to increase debt necessary to finance the extremely ambitious project. Skepticism regarding the discussed recovery plan for the EU enjoys cross-party agreement in Germany, whose economy is also slowing down. Regarding defense, Berlin seems to be sitting on the fence: on one hand, the interests of German arms companies are important, but on the other, where it's convenient, they prefer non-EU solutions.\\nThe plan as a whole contains many elements worth discussing. In terms of defense, it is worth agreeing with Draghi that Europe spends too little on defense, including R&D and industry development. Defense cooperation in procurement should also be developed because, despite not always good experiences, the scale of joint orders should bring numerous benefits.\\nHowever, this requires systemic solutions, including harmonizing the requirements for equipment by various armies and creating uniform procurement procedures. On the other hand, cooperation with countries outside the EU does not necessarily have to endanger the EU economy; it can even support the realization of member states' global aspirations. Examples include the British-Italian-Japanese GCAP aviation program or, if it succeeds, the Polish-Korean cooperation.\\nThe proposed integration of European defense, while potentially beneficial for the EU as a whole, also carries the risk of weakening or even eliminating smaller players in the market. While Draghi cites the USA as a positive example, Americans are currently seeking ways to rebuild smaller, more innovative companies.\\nRead also:\\nRussia leads as U.S. modernizes infrared tracking technology\\nEU reports uptick in Russian gas imports despite overall decline\\nRussia's secret plan to bypass sanctions with Indian electronics\",\n",

Whatever you want to call it, the distinctive performance style of a female gibbon is a dance, researchers say.\\nKai Caspar, a zoologist at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf in Germany, and colleagues analyzed the stylized movements of certain gibbons. They found that the key characteristics of human dance are also present in the gibbons' choreography. The findings have been posted online ahead of publication in the journal Primates.\\nGibbons are long-armed apes that live in Asian tropical forests. Dr. Caspar became interested in their dancing when he was trying to learn how gibbons in zoos responded to a mirror. The apes didn't show recognition of their reflections — but they did show off their moves.\\n'The body becomes stiff, and then these robot-dance-like movements commence,' Dr. Caspar said.\\nEarlier research had described hundreds of dances by four wild female gibbons in China. The gibbons were living in groups that each had two females but only one adult male. Peering up into the treetops, the researchers saw the females seeming to use dance to solicit their male's attention. That male sometimes reacted to dances by grooming the female, or mating with her.\\nTo study dances in more gibbon species, Dr. Caspar teamed up with Camille Coye, a primatologist at the Institut Jean Nicod in Paris, and Pritty Patel-Grosz, a linguistics professor at the University of Oslo who studies dance and gesture.\\nDr. Patel-Grosz said they defined dance as an intentional movement that's rhythmic and doesn't serve a physical purpose, like walking or scratching an itch does.\\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

I'm not afraid for this situation, I know his qualities, I know his personality and I know he'll fight back.\\n'The other thing is he had a very difficult pre-season because he didn't play games.

       "   'excerpt': \"Shocking Blue's manager Cees van Leeuwen, an overbearing man, was one reason for the premature ending of the Dutch band, and its limited success ('Venus') in America.\",\n",
       "   'summary': \"4-3-2-1 Hot and Sweet, Musiksendung, Deutschland 1970, Gaststar: niederländische Band Shocking Blue.\\nOf the four members of the Dutch classic rock group, Shocking Blue, just one is still with us: lead guitarist and chief songwriter Robbie van Leeuwen, 79. The band was a sensation worldwide, with hits like 'Venus,' 'Never Marry A Railroad Man' and 'Send Me A Postcard.' Curiously, though, only 'Venus' made it big in America.\\nRecently I wrote two stories about Shocking Blue (links below), but most of my research for them was from secondary sources. Here, I was able to search out, and reach Dick Bakker, 77, the group's original sound engineer and co-producer, for some firsthand information.\\nBakker is a lot more than just Shocking Blue. He has worked for more than half-a-century in the music business, mostly classical and not just rock. In 1974, he launched the Dick Bakker Orchestra, then worked in England with The London Philharmonic. Bakker was also musical director for Metropole Orkest in The Netherlands for many years. An excellent book about his life, Behind The Scenes Of Music,' was published in 2016. Following are edited excerpts from a conversation with Bakker.\\nDick Bakker's Dick Bakker Orchestra celebrates its 50-year anniversary this year.\\nJim Clash: All bands have points of contention, some which ultimately lead to their demise. What was it in Shocking Blue?\\nDick Bakker: Shocking Blue had a manager named Cees van Leeuwen (no relation to Robbie van Leeuwen). He had a domineering personality and interfered with everything. It was very unpleasant to work with him. Robbie was a very calm and friendly guy who was eager to get the best out of his compositions with my help. I always supported him, trying to achieve the best sound. I would sometimes make musical adjustments and arrange extra instruments where necessary to create the best final product.\\nClash: How about Mariska Veres? Many in America liken her to Grace Slick of Jefferson Airplane, but without the extracurricular wild lifestyle.\\n(Eingeschränkte Rechte für bestimmte redaktionelle Kunden in Deutschland. Limited rights for specific editorial clients in Germany.) Mariska Veres (Shocking Blue). Bei TV-Auftritt. (Photo by ARTCO-Berlin/ullstein bild via Getty Images)\\nBakker: Mariska was a very kind and sweet singer who did her utmost to achieve the best. However, if something went wrong, Cees would make incredibly nasty remarks like, 'Stupid bitch, sing it properly!' We all found that horrible. Mariska was a beautiful woman, and, if I recall correctly, had a relationship with Shocking Blue's road manager.\\nClash: How were Shocking Blue's songs recorded back then?\\nBakker: The recordings were usually done quickly. At that time, we used two or four tracks, so everything had to be done right the first time. I worked extensively with special compressors and EQ to get the best result. Mariska always sang very well, and the vocals were recorded separately from the band. The long list of hits can be found on my website under 'Hit Files, Single Hits.'\\nShocking Blue's No. 1 single in America, circa late 1960s.\\nClash: 'Venus' was the big hit in America, of course. What are your memories of recording that particular song so many decades ago?\\nBakker: When the mix of 'Venus' was finished and everyone happily went home, I received a call from Cees a few days later. He said the mix wasn't good and had to be redone: 'It sounds like crap!' Unfortunately, or fortunately, the master tape had already been sent to America and was in production. When 'Venus' reached No. 1, Cees said in every subsequent production that it had to sound like 'Venus.' Apparently, he had forgotten that he didn't like that original mix!\\nClash: The band broke up in 1975. What did Mariska end up doing?\\nBakker: Yes, in 1975, the group did break up. In 1979, they tried to work together again, but it didn't really succeed. After two years, they stopped. I wasn't involved in that reunion. In 1993, Mariska performed again with a new lineup of Shocking Blue, but without Robbie. She also performed with the band The Clacks, made up of members from the well-known Dutch pop group Golden Earring. She continued performing until her passing [from cancer] in 1996.\\n(GERMANY OUT) Shocking Blue - Musikgruppe, Rockmusik, Niederlande - Mariska Veres (center left), Robbie van Leeuwen (far right), Klaasje van der Wal (far left) und Cornelius 'Cor' van der Beek (center right) (Reihenfolge unklar) - 01.09.1969 (Photo by Peter Timm\\\\ullstein bild via Getty Images)\\nClash: How was it working with Shocking Blue's excellent bassist, Klaasje van der Wal, and drummer, Cor van der Beek? The latter had a substance-abuse problem as I understand it. Did that ever manifest itself in the recording studio?\\nBakker: During the time I worked with Shocking Blue, Cor and Klaasje were always very professional and focused. There were no drugs or heavy drinking. We were all focused on creating the best possible final product. I often worked with Robbie on musical adjustments to make the songs more beautiful and commercial. Promotion in America suffered from poor management. Otherwise, they would have had more hits there.\",\n",

Guardiola does not expect to have Ake available until after the October international break, which would mean missing seven matches, including games versus Arsenal and Inter in the Champions League.\\nBobb will also miss those matches and more after having surgery on a fractured bone in his leg before the season started. Guardiola said three to four months out in mid-August, which could coincide with the November international break or extend further than that into December.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"InterCure Ltd. INCR has shown resilience in its H1 2024 performance despite facing significant challenges, according to equity research by Pablo Zuanic of Zuanic & Associates. The company reported revenues of 126 million NIS ($33.97 million), surpassing the estimated 121 million NIS.\\nHowever, this is still below pre-October 2023 levels of 414 million NIS, mainly due to the ongoing disruption at its southern Israeli facility, which has been occupied by the IDF. The company invested heavily in restoring this facility and expects it to return to full operational capacity in the coming quarters.\\nCash Reserves Plummet: Government Compensation Boosts EBITDA\\nInterCure reported an EBITDA of 17.6 million NIS for H1 2024, compared to the 5 million NIS estimate. However, this includes government compensation for damages caused by the conflict, which makes comparisons difficult.\\nThe company ended June with 21 million NIS in cash, down from 111 million NIS in December 2023. Additionally, Zuanic noted the net debt increased from 60 million NIS to 112 million NIS over the same period, although the company has access to an unused credit line of over 22 million NIS.\\nDouble-Digit Growth On The Horizon\\nLooking ahead, InterCure is guiding for double-digit sales growth in H2 2024, with revenues expected to reach around 140 million NIS, lower than previous estimates of 180 million NIS.\\nThe company's expansion strategy includes launching more than 30 new GMP SKUs in collaboration with brands such as Cookies, Binske and Organigram OGI. InterCure plans to introduce Cookies products in Germany by Q4 2024, in addition to ongoing sales in the UK.\\nStock Performance And Valuation\\nThe stock has experienced a drop from its May 2024 peak of $3.12 to $1.97. Despite the decline, Zuanic notes that the company's valuation remains attractive, with the stock trading at 1x sales and 8x EBITDA for CY25.\\nInterCure's enterprise value is currently estimated by Zuanic at $132 million, including $96 million in market capitalization and $36 million in net debt.\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'A billionaire investor who predicted the global financial crisis has warned that the US election risks tipping the world\\'s biggest economy into serious disorder.In a week when candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump finally faced each other in a televised debate, Ray Dalio said his biggest fear was for democracy no matter who wins on 4 November.Mr Dalio founded the world\\'s largest hedge fund and is closely-watched by other investors for his stock-picks.In an interview with the BBC, he said: \\'There\\'s a possibility that the loser, particularly if it\\'s the Republicans and Donald Trump, might not accept losing and you have a situation where it\\'s a win-at-all-cost by both the left and the right, so neither side can compromise.\\'My great fear is for democracy,\\' he said.Regardless of the victor, Mr Dalio said he expected there to be internal migration between states based on political, economic and moral dividing lines.\\'A lot of people in states like California and New York and New Jersey and so on, will go to states like Florida and Texas, partially because of taxes, but partially because of values,\\' he said. \\'There\\'s a big gap in values\\'.\\n\\'This reminds me of the 1930 to 45 period in which there was an economic crisis followed by democracies becoming dictatorships. Germany, Italy, Spain and Japan had parliamentary systems, and they broke down in terms of internal conflict between the the hard left, the hard right, communism and fascism. We are today seeing modern day versions of some of these things\\', he said.There is some evidence that US migration based on values is already happening. Elon Musk announced in July he would move the headquarters of his companies X and SpaceX from California to Texas citing new rules banning schools from notifying parents that children wanted their gender redefined.Dalio, now 75, is the founder of Bridgewater Associates - the world\\'s largest hedge fund with $124bn in assets . He says he thought the probability of civil war was \"low, but cannot be dismissed.\\'\\nDalio, mercifully, does not claim he is infallible. But he insists he is more often right than wrong.\\'He who lives by the crystal ball is destined to eat ground glass. But I\\'ve been right in the markets about 65% of the time\\', he said.But on the most immediate question in the US he is hedging his bets and refuses to be drawn on whether he thinks Trump or Harris will win.\\'I do not know how this election is going to turn out and how these things will turn out. I do know that we have an exceptionally high probability of instability\\', he concluded.',\n",

That was the first time Xabi Alonso's title-winning team had lost in the Bundesliga for 15 months.\\nBoniface set up Martin Terrier for Leverkusen's first goal and scored himself soon after, beating defender Alexander Prass and leaving him sprawled on the ground and he scored past goalkeeper Oliver Baumann.\\nLeverkusen's three games in the league this season have seen a combined 15 goals scored, in part because of lapses in concentration in defense that have frustrated coach Alonso.\\nMergim Berisha's goal for Hoffenheim in the 37th minute cut Leverkusen's lead to 2-1 and Alonso's team nearly conceded another soon after. However, Leverkusen took control again after the break and a penalty from Florian Wirtz and another goal from Boniface ensured a 4-1 win.\\nIt was the first time Boniface had scored twice in a game since an adductor muscle injury ruled the Nigerian striker out of much of the second half of last season as Leverkusen won the title.\\nKeeper denies Leipzig\\nUnion goalkeeper Frederik Ronnow frustrated Leipzig in a goalless draw, saving a penalty from Loïs Openda and a stoppage-time free kick from David Raum.

       "   'summary': \"Keir Starmer and Joe Biden have discussed letting Ukraine fire long-range, western-supplied missiles into Russia, while stopping short of any formal announcement. Vladimir Putin has threatened it would amount to Nato joining the war. The UK prime minister told reporters at the White House that he had a 'wide-ranging discussion about strategy' with the US president but that it was not just a meeting about 'a particular capability'.\\nBefore the meeting, officials had said Starmer would press Biden to back his plan to let British Storm Shadow be used to strike inside Russia. Britain's PM indicated he and Biden would discuss the plan at the UN general assembly in New York the week after next 'with a wider group of individuals'.\\nBiden dismissed Vladimir Putin's sabre-rattling threats, saying he did not accept that Ukraine using Storm Shadows missiles against Russia proper would amount to Nato going to war with Moscow, reports Dan Sabbagh in Washington. 'I do not think much about Vladimir Putin,' Biden said.\\nMoscow's ambassador to the UN told the security council on Friday that loosening the missile strike restrictions would mark an escalation to 'direct war' between Moscow and Nato. Washington officials accused Putin of trying to scare Nato countries away from supporting Ukraine, reports Andrew Roth. In Europe, leaders played down Putin's threats. The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said: 'I would not attach excessive importance to the latest statements from President Putin. They rather show the difficult situation the Russians have on the front.'\\nZelenskiy said the Ukrainian incursion into Russia's border region of Kursk had produced the desired result of slowing Moscow's advance on another front in Ukraine's east. The Ukrainian president said in Kyiv on Friday that Russia's counterattack in Kursk produced no major successes – contradicting Vladimir Putin's accounts of Russian advances on both fronts. Zelenskiy said Russia had about 40,000 troops on the Kursk front. 'So far we have seen no serious [Russian] success.' Russia's defence ministry said on Friday its troops had taken back 10 villages out of 100 that Kyiv had occupied. The battlefield reports of either side were not able to be independently verified.\\nThe Ukrainian general staff said on Friday that Russian forces had focused their assaults near the town of Kurakhove, about 33km (20 miles) south of the key logistics hub of Pokrovsk in Ukraine's Donetsk region. Russia's defence ministry said its forces had captured Dolynivka, positioned between Pokrovsk and Kurakhove, the latest in a series of localities Moscow says it has seized.\\nVolodymyr Zelenskiy said 49 Ukrainian prisoners of war had been returned from Russia, with Agence France-Presse witnessing the group being greeted at the border with Belarus. The Ukrainian president did not clarify whether it was part of an exchange with Russia, as is usually the case, but AFP journalists had earlier seen Russian prisoners of war being loaded on to a bus near the border.\\nRomania started training its first group of Ukrainian F-16 pilots this week, the Nato country's defence ministry said. The first four pilots had started their 'theoretical training', a ministry spokesperson told AFP, with practical training to follow 'towards the end of the year'.\\nDrone fragments fell on a municipal building in Kyiv's Obolon district north of the city centre early on Saturday, said the mayor. Writing on Telegram, Vitali Klitschko said no fire broke out and emergency services were sent. He earlier said air defence units had been in action. A Reuters witness said explosions were heard. The head of Kyiv's military administration, Serhiy Popko, urged people to remain in shelters as drones still posed a threat. The air raid alert was later lifted for the city but remained in effect for several regions of central Ukraine.\\nRussia announced it had revoked the accreditation of six British diplomats in Moscow on accusations of espionage. Moscow's FSB domestic spy agency said on Friday that it acted on documents showing part of the UK Foreign Office was helping coordinate what it called 'the escalation of the political and military situation' in Ukraine. The Foreign Office, however, said the move had been made last month as part of a continuing diplomatic tit-for-tat. Sources indicated the British diplomats had left Russia weeks ago and were already being replaced.\\nThe US has imposed new sanctions on Russia over its role to 'undermine democracies', the US secretary of state said. 'The actions we're exposing today and the actions we exposed last week do not incorporate the full scope of Russia's efforts to undermine democracies,' Antony Blinken said. 'Far from it.'\\nVolodymyr Zelenskiy said he would meet Joe Biden 'this month' to present his 'victory plan' on how to end the war with Russia. The Ukrainian leader gave no details on how to end more than 30 months of fighting, saying only that his proposal would involve 'a system of interconnected solutions that will give Ukraine enough power – enough to put this war on a course to peace'.\\nThe German chancellor has said he will not send long-range missiles requested by Ukraine. Germany possesses powerful Taurus cruise missiles. Olaf Scholz said on Friday: 'Germany has made a clear decision about what we will do and what we will not do. This decision will not change.'\\nBoris Johnson met with Zelenskiy in Kyiv and renewed calls for permission for Storm Shadow strikes on Russia aimed at 'stopping the appalling Russian attacks with glide bombs and now Iranian missiles'. Zelenskiy also met with The American actor Michael Douglas and his son Dylan in Kyiv. The Ukrainian president said that they, alongside Ukraine's first lady, Olena Zelenska, discussed 'the situation in our country, cooperation with partners, support for Ukraine, and the fourth Summit of Ladies and Gentlemen'.\\nUkraine's government has approved a 2025 draft budget with a strong focus on defence spending, the prime minister said. Denys Shmyhal said on Friday that the draft, to be submitted to parliament, provided for 2tn hryvnias (US$48.2bn) in revenues and 3.6tn hryvnias in expenditures. The draft also included a provision of 2.22tn hryvnias (US$53.5bn) for defence. 'The priority for this budget is very clear – the country's defence and security,' he said. 'We will again direct all domestic resources to these objectives.'\",\n",

Germany, Italy, Spain and Japan had parliamentary systems, and they broke down in terms of internal conflict between the the hard left, the hard right, communism and fascism. We are today seeing modern day versions of some of these things\\', he said.\\nThere is some evidence that US migration based on values is already happening. Elon Musk announced in July he would move the headquarters of his companies X and SpaceX from California to Texas citing new rules banning schools from notifying parents that children wanted their gender redefined.\\nDalio, now 75, is the founder of Bridgewater Associates - the world\\'s largest hedge fund with $124bn in assets .

       "   'summary': 'It might sound like a wind up, but a group of scientists have discovered that some mammals like mice, pigs and rats can breath through their bottoms!Their cheeky discovery has led them to be awarded one of this year\\'s Ig Nobel Prizes.The annual awards look at the funny side of science and have been taking place for more than thirty years. Keep reading to find out some of this year\\'s other winners and let us know your favourite in the comments.\\nWhat is the Ig Nobel Prize?\\nThe Ig Nobel Prize awards are presented every year by a US science humour magazine. They celebrate unusual experiments; ones which might make people laugh as well as think.The \\'Igs\\' - as they\\'re known - are a light-hearted alternative to the world famous Nobel Prize awards.The Nobel Prize are awarded each year to a group or individual who has made a big contribution in one of several categories - Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics, and Physiology or Medicine.Lots of famous people have won a Nobel Prize, including Albert Einstein, Mother Teresa and Martin Luther King.So, the Ig Nobels aren\\'t real Nobel Prizes, but they are still important prizes for science.A lot of research goes into experiments and some help with real problems in the world.There are 10 Ig award categories which included medicine, biology and probability.\\nWho were some of the 2024 Ig Nobel Prize winners?\\nThe Physiology Prize (the study of how the human body works) went to an international team of Japanese and US researchers for discovering that many mammals can breathe through their bottoms.They said they were inspired by loach fishes, which are capable of breathing through their intestines. The team found that many mammals, including mice, pigs and rats, can absorb oxygen (which is the gas that our lungs absorb when we breathe in) when it is delivered through their bottoms!The scientists said their findings suggested that in the future, guts could also be used as an \"accessory breathing organ.\"An international team of scientists led by academics in Germany picked up the Ig Nobel Prize for Probability, which involved the team flipping more than 350,000 coins! They found that when people flip a coin it \"wobbles\" in the air, making it slightly more likely to land on the same side it started.The experiment was carried out over 81 days, using 44 different currencies.Lead researcher Frantisek Bartos explained that it was \"fun to do some stupid stuff from time to time.\"Other Ig Nobel winners included scientists in France who investigated whether hair on the heads of people in the northern hemisphere swirled in the same direction as those from the south.They found that while the hair whorls of most people swirl clockwise (left to right) - in the southern hemisphere, counter-clockwise whorls are more common!',\n",

       "   'summary': \"Billionaire investor and founder of Bridgewater Associates Ray Dalio warns that the US election could cause chaos if the loser, especially Donald Trump, refuses to concede, resulting in a cutthroat all-or-nothing approach from both sides.\\nIn a recent interview with the BBC, Dalio highlighted that many people from states such as California, New York, and New Jersey are likely to move to states like Florida and Texas, driven partly by tax considerations and partly by differing values.\\n'My great fear is for democracy,' Dalio told BBC.\\nIn an interview with the Financial Times earlier this year, Dalio suggested that the chance of a civil conflict in the U.S. could be as high as 40%, reflecting his serious worries about the nation's current state. He clarified that this civil war wouldn't involve physical violence but rather an intensification of political polarization.\\nIn this scenario, individuals would relocate to states that better align with their values and ignore federal decisions made by opposing political factions, as he explained to the Financial Times.\\nDuring a week marked by the televised debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, Dalio expressed his deep concern for the future of democracy, regardless of the outcome on November 4.\\n'This reminds me of the 1930 to '45 period in which there was an economic crisis followed by democracies becoming dictatorships,' Dalio told BBC.\\nDalio noted that Germany, Italy, Spain, and Japan experienced the breakdown of their parliamentary systems due to internal conflicts among the far left, far right, communism, and fascism, and he observed that modern versions of these issues are currently emerging.\\nAccording to a December Gallup survey, only 28% of US adults are currently satisfied with how democracy functions in the country, marking a new low compared to the previous low of 35% recorded shortly after the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack. Satisfaction levels vary significantly between political affiliations, with 38% of Democrats and just 17% of Republicans expressing contentment. Additionally, those with less formal education tend to be less satisfied with the state of democracy.\\n'I do not know how this election is going to turn out and how these things will turn out. I do know that we have an exceptionally high probability of instability', Dalio informed the BBC.\\nWhy Dalio's Views Are Significant?\\nThere is some indication that migration in the US based on personal values is already underway, as predicted by Dalio. For instance, in July, Elon Musk declared his decision to relocate the headquarters of his companies, X and SpaceX, from California to Texas, BBC added.\\nMusk cited new regulations in California that prohibit schools from informing parents if their children wish to change their gender identity as a key reason for the move.\\nReflecting on his predictive track record, Dalio told the BBC, 'I've been right in the markets about 65% of the time.'\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Manchester City are top of the league, obviously. Pep Guardiola's side have won their first three Premier League games this season, obviously. Erling Haaland is on fire, obviously.\\nThe Norwegian striker already has seven goals this season, including a pair of hat-tricks. All is well at the Etihad and, like the Terminator, they absolutely will not stop.\\nBrentford, less predictably, are also going well in the early stages of the season. One might have expected the departure of Ivan Toney for pastures new to have caused issues for Thomas Frank's side but they've won two and lost just the match against Liverpool, the only side other than City with a 100 per cent record this term.\\nAdded to this, somewhat surprisingly, Brentford are the last away team to have won at the Etihad in any competition. That victory came back in November 2022 and, since that loss, City have won 38 games and drawn seven at home.\\nCity will be without Nathan Ake after he picked up an ankle injury on international duty while representing the Netherlands against Germany. Rodri has yet to play for the champions this season, but seems likely to return after featuring in Spain's 4-1 Nations League win over Switzerland last weekend. Joshua Dasilva, Rico Henry, Igor Thiago and Aaron Hickey are all on Brentford's injury list although there is the possibility of Kristoffer Ajer's foot problem clearing up in time for the trip to City.\\nIt was confirmed on Friday that the hearing into Manchester City's 115 charges will begin on Monday so that will undoubtedly be an unwelcome distraction for Guardiola and his players (though they're invariably going to insist otherwise). Added to this is the news of Mikel Arteta agreeing a new deal at Arsenal and suddenly things seem a little calmer for City's main title contenders the last couple of years than they do in the blue half of Manchester. Manchester City vs Brentford odds\\nOdds updated as of 8 p.m. BST Friday. Man City win: 1/5 (-500)\\n1/5 (-500) Draw: 13/2 (+650)\\n13/2 (+650) Brentford win: 23/2 (+1150)\\nVenue: Etihad Stadium — Manchester\\nTime: 3 p.m. BST (10 a.m. ET), Saturday Form guide\\nManchester City: 3-0-0, 9 points (1st); W-W-W\\nBrentford: 2-0-1, 6 points (6th); W-L-W Match prediction\\nManchester City 2-0 Brentford\\nThey say lightning doesn't strike twice and, while it's not scientifically accurate, there is a certain metaphorical truth to the adage. It's hard to see Brentford winning at the Etihad again, especially since Toney scored a brace that day. A comfortable home win seems much more likely so let's go with 2-0.\\n(Photo of Erling Haaland: Henry Nicholls / AFP via Getty Images)\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'A Northern Ireland football team whose players received life-changing organ donations has taken part in their first world cup.The Transplant Football World Cup was held over the last week in Cervia, Italy, with 11 teams and 180 players.Orla Smyth, one of the joint managers of the Northern Ireland team, said it was a good opportunity to meet people who have had similar experiences as organ donor recipients.\\'It\\'s competitive football, but none of us would be alive and playing if it wasn\\'t for our donors, and that\\'s a big element of appreciation,\\' she said.\\nThe tournament began last Sunday with the teams split into two groups. The structure of the games involves seven-a-side teams playing fifteen-minute halves.The rules mirror those of a standard football game and group competition. The only difference is there are two referees, and players are not allowed to have contact.Orla said playing sport had been ruled out previously because of the risk involved for patients after their transplants. However, specialists later decided that the risk was \\'minimal\\'.\\'They\\'ve adapted the rules a little bit so that transplant recipients feel more comfortable getting into playing post-transplant.\\'\\n\\'I thought I\\'d never play again\\'\\nThe team formed in the last year when organisers went on a recruitment drive around hospitals in Northern Ireland.\\'It\\'s getting the word out there to get people back into the sport so they can keep themselves fit and well physically and mentally,\\' she said.One of the players who found out about the team while in hospital was Mark Hughes.Mark had a kidney transplant 17 months ago and was handed a leaflet about transplant sports while recovering.\\'I thought, \\'Why not get involved?\\' I think it\\'s good because you get to meet people who are in the same circumstances as you,\" he said.Since finding out about transplant sports, Mark has competed at the British Transplant Games and was also in Italy for the football world cup.Mark said he had a lot to reflect on after the team played their final game in Italy.\\'Just over a year ago, I thought I would never play football again, so to get that opportunity made me quite emotional. So onwards and upwards. We\\'re building for the future.\\'\\nNorthern Ireland faced Spain, Australia, America, and Chile in the group stages of the World Cup in Italy.The team did not make it to the next stage, but Mark said that has not deterred them.\\'We have only been together a short time, and these teams have probably been together for years. So for us, it\\'s like a building process; we\\'ll get bigger and we\\'ll get stronger,\\' said Mark.Another special element for the players is that one of the referees, Arlene Campbell, is also from Northern Ireland and is a living donor.\\nThe team have returned to Northern Ireland and are setting their sights on the world transplant games in Germany next year, as well as preparing for the next transplant football contest in 2026.\\'It gives us two years to prepare and to really properly form the football team,\\' said Orla.With only four women out of 180 participants competing at this year\\'s cup, Orla wants to see a drive for more women to take part.\\'It would be very difficult to get an all Northern Irish female football team, but I would like to think there\\'d be an international element for female footballers from all around the world to come together and just play football,\" she said.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"Hopes for a big rate cut from the Federal Reserve next week got suddenly revived, sending the Dow near an all-time high.\\nStock and bond traders ramped up bets on Friday that the Fed could slash interest rates by 50 basis points — or half a percentage point — after the Wall Street Journal reported that central bankers have become increasingly focused on the health of the US job market versus inflation.\\nThe Dow was recently up 287 points to 41,384 — not far off its Aug. 30 record of 41,563.\\nAfter practically writing off the chance of a 50-basis-point cut earlier this week, traders in swaps markets most recently were predicting a 47% chance that Fed officials could opt for a bumper cut at a policy meeting next week.\\nStill, in what it is expected to be the first lowering of rates since 2020, a thin majority of 53% chance are forecasting the more typical rate cut of 25 basis points on the central bank's current key lending rate of 5.25% to 5.5%.\\n'A couple of articles were published in the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times suggesting that a 50-bps move was still in play, which has led markets to once again reevaluate their expectations,' Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note to clients.\\nFormer Federal Reserve chair Bill Dudley said on Friday there was 'a strong case' for the larger cut at a forum in Singapore.\\n'I know what I'd be pushing for,' said Dudley, who led the New York Fed until 2018. 'The question is why don't you just get started? It's basically up to Chairman Powell to see how much support he has for being more aggressive.'\\nBob Savage, head of markets strategy at BNY Mellon, said that investors want the Fed 'to ease fast and get on with the risk of recession fighting.'\\nThe reportedly planned cut comes after August's lower-than-expected lab our market numbers in which there were 142,000 jobs created.\\n'The time has come for policy to adjust,' Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in his keynote speech at the Fed's annual economic conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming last month. 'The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.'\\nA cut in interest rates would lower borrowing costs for American households by making repayments on credit cards and home loans cheaper.\\nThat, in turn, could also potentially encourage customers to spend and businesses to invest in a move that would boost the US economy less than two months before the election amid fears of a possible recession.\\nInflation – the price rise in key goods – appears to have been tamed in recent months after the Fed kept interest rates unchanged for the past 14 months.\\nIn August, consumer prices rose 2.5% ahead of November's presidential vote where the cost of living is expected to be one of the major issues as Americans head to the polls.\\nThat is down from its recent peak of 9.1% in June 2022 when governments worldwide were dealing with the fallout from the global coronavirus pandemic.\\nUBS's Brian Rose, senior US economist, wrote in a note that 'the inflation data has been good enough to allow the Fed to start cutting rates in September, but does not give them a reason to cut aggressively.'\\n'If the Fed does 25, not 50 bps, investors will need to reconsider some of the more optimistic cyclical rally or no recession narratives,' said Arnim Holzer, Global Macro Strategist at Easterly EAB Risk Solutions.\\nThe Fed would be joining a global rate cut cycle after the European Central Bank, which sets rates for the 20-nation single currency eurozone, announced its second rate cut on Thursday in three months.\\nECB officials in Frankfurt, Germany pointed to slowing inflation and stronger economic growth as the reasons for the cut in interest rates.\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'Several beaches are right at our doorstep whenever we fancy a walk, a swim, or a surf, and there are hiking trails all around us. We built this life centered on freedom. A rigid schedule does not dictate our work, and we certainly don\\'t have to plan our trips around any school holidays.\\nOur kid-free life is great\\nBesides feeding our two cats, we don\\'t have to get out of bed on a Sunday morning, especially when the cool Atlantic breeze is blowing. Sometimes, there\\'s a heavy mist lingering, creating a cozy vibe, perfect for a day spent binge-watching Netflix on our unstained couch.\\nWhile we\\'re both happy with our decision not to have kids today, we weren\\'t always on the same page regarding this topic. I seesawed between \\'yes\\' and \\'no\\' for several years, not quite knowing if kids were something I wanted or something everyone else wanted for me. Though my husband didn\\'t want kids, he also never pushed me either way, which I\\'m grateful for.\\nThe circle of friends we\\'ve been cultivating since moving to Portugal\\'s coast in 2018 has been growing each year. It mostly consists of other childless couples (or couples with grown-up children), surfers, business owners and freelancers, and expats from countries like Germany, Poland, France, Venezuela, and Spain.\\nI started questioning things after a couple we know had a baby\\nRecently, though, our perfectly crafted child-free lifestyle has been turned upside down. A couple we\\'re close with has had a baby. Though we haven\\'t spent time with them and their baby yet, my anxious mind instantly started painting a dire picture: Fun lunches, boozy dinners, grownup activities, and meetups would be replaced by a whole lot of baby talk, diaper changes, and high-pitched background noises.\\nWhile this thought makes me clench my jaw muscles, it has also unearthed a question — or rather, an avalanche of questions.\\nAre we making a mistake by not having children? Did we miss something when designing our child-free life? Will we regret our decision to live on our own terms without the chaos and beauty of raising a child? Is this really the life we want?\\nThe life we created for ourselves is undoubtedly an incredibly privileged one, but the fundamental question our friends\\' decision has stirred up is, \"Are the two of us going to be enough for the rest of our lives?\"\\nI\\'m not exactly sure whether it\\'s just FOMO rearing its head or if there is something else beneath this superficial feeling of missing out on the \\'baby experience\\' — something more profound that will haunt us later in life and fill us with regret.\\nI\\'m picturing my husband and me — all shriveled up and gray — sitting at an empty dinner table, just the two of us. Maybe there\\'s a dog or two. Maybe some cats, but no offspring. No grown-up child of ours with their own family filling the empty seats around the table.\\nIt\\'s the fear of ending up alone that\\'s being triggered in me by this recent baby event. Maybe the fear of growing old alone motivates many to have children. But is it a good enough reason? And does being childless automatically mean that we\\'re going to be lonely when we\\'re old?\\nI haven\\'t shared these newly triggered fears with my husband (yet). However, knowing him, I suspect the picture I painted of us — old and gray, yet still together with a bunch of beloved pets — is his greatest hope, not his greatest fear.\\nWe can\\'t predict the future and know how we\\'re going to feel about our decisions down the line, but one thing has become clear to me: It\\'s important to life a life that feels authentic to you. If that life includes children, then go for it. If it doesn\\'t, don\\'t be afraid to choose a different path.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"The Biden administration accused Russia's global TV network RT on Friday of carrying out covert information warfare operations around the world as an arm of Moscow's spy agencies, including raising funds to buy weapons for Russian forces waging war against Ukraine.\\nCiting declassified intelligence, U.S. officials announced new sanctions against Russian state media and said the administration was launching a diplomatic effort to inform foreign partners about RT, the state-funded outlet that they said had secretly pushed out propaganda through media sites in South America, Europe and Africa while hiding the Kremlin's fingerprints.\\n'RT wants its new covert intelligence capabilities, like its longstanding propaganda and disinformation efforts, to remain hidden,' Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters. 'Our most powerful antidote to Russia's lies is the truth. It's shining a bright light on what the Kremlin is trying to do under the cover of darkness,' he said.\\nLast week, the administration focused on Russia's alleged efforts to meddle in the U.S. election and undermine support for Ukraine, unveiling indictments, sanctions and other measures to counter what it called Moscow's aggressive campaign to shape politics and sow divisions in America. On Friday, State Department officials sought to highlight Russia's information operations around the world.\\nJames Rubin, coordinator for the State Department's Global Engagement Center, said RT was much more than a state-funded media outlet — 'a fully fledged member of the intelligence apparatus and operation of the Russian government' for the war in Ukraine.\\nRT now has a cyberintelligence unit embedded in the organization with ties to Russian spy services and has used a crowdfunding platform to secure weaponry and other support for Russian forces waging war against Ukraine, Rubin and other officials said.\\n'A large online crowdfunding platform operating within the quasi-intelligence, state-funded RT and through social media channels is providing material support and weaponry to Russia's military units in Ukraine,' including sniper rifles, body armor night-vision goggles, drones, radio gear and diesel generators, the State Department said in a statement. Some of the equipment came from China, including reconnaissance drones, it said.\\nThrough proxy media outlets that purport to be independent, Russia is disseminating information to back its invasion of Ukraine, officials said. Using front companies and other intelligence tactics, RT covertly recruits and pays social media personalities to churn out content that hides Russia's involvement, officials said.\\nRT's propaganda and 'disinformation' has helped undercut international support for Ukraine, Rubin said.\\n'One of the reasons, not the only reason, but one of the reasons why so much of the world has not been as fully supportive of Ukraine as you would think they would be, given that Russia has invaded Ukraine and violated rule number one of the international system, it's because of the broad scope and reach of RT, where propaganda, disinformation and lies are spread to millions, if not billions of people around the world.'\\nIn Africa, RT allegedly is behind an online platform called 'African Stream' but hides its role, officials said. In Germany, RT secretly runs a Berlin-based English-language site known as 'Red' and in France, RT hired a journalist in Paris to carry out 'influence projects' aimed at a French-speaking audience, according to U.S. officials.\\nIn Argentina, the U.S. accused Russia of being engaged 'in operations meant to destabilize the government of Argentina and escalate tensions between Argentina and its neighbors,' the State Department statement said.\\nThe Biden administration is imposing sanctions on a state-funded broadcaster that oversees the RT outlet, TV-Novosti, another state media company, Rossiya Segodnya, and its director Dmitry Kiselyov, officials said.\\nThe state media groups Segodnya and Novosti, working with the Russian government, allegedly have planned to foment unrest in Moldova and interfere in that country's upcoming presidential election, officials said.\\nRussian state-funded media was also targeted for sanctions for allegedly funneling money into Moldova under the guise of humanitarian aid 'to buy votes to influence the upcoming Moldovan elections,' officials said.\\nRussia has previously denied running information operations to interfere in America's elections or in other country's politics.\\nRussia's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com\",\n",

Dell and Palantir were two of the largest companies not in the S&P 500, with $72 billion and $68 billion market caps, respectively.

Workday is a leading software provider, Apollo a big alternative asset manager, like KKR and Blackstone, and insurer and annuity provider. Blackstone joined in 2023; KKR in July.\\nMarvell Technology ($57 billion) may take longer. S&P requires generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, cumulative profits over the most recent four quarters and during the latest quarter. The chip maker, like many tech companies, is profitable based on non-GAAP earnings that add back stock compensation to earnings, but not on a GAAP basis, which treats stock comp as an expense.\\nCoinbase Global, Trade Desk, and Ferguson Enterprises are also candidates.

       "   'summary': \"CNN —\\nThere isn't much green in the Sahara Desert, but after an unusual influx of rain, the color can be seen from space creeping into parts of one of the driest places in the world.\\nSatellites recently captured plant life blooming in parts of the typically arid southern Sahara after storms moved there when they shouldn't. It has also caused catastrophic flooding. And scientists say a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution is making both more likely.\\nRainfall north of the equator in Africa typically increases from July through September as the West African Monsoon kicks into gear.\\nThe phenomenon is marked by an increase in stormy weather that erupts when moist, tropical air from near the equator meets hot, dry air from the northern portion of the continent. The focus for this stormy weather – known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone – shifts north of the equator in the Northern Hemisphere's summer months. Much of it sags south of the equator during the Southern Hemisphere's warm months.\\nBut since at least mid-July, this zone has shifted farther north than it typically should, sending storms into the southern Sahara, including portions of Niger, Chad, Sudan and even as far north as Libya, according to data from NOAA's Climate Prediction Center.\\nAs a result, these portions of the Sahara Desert are anywhere from twice as wet to more than six times wetter than they should be.\\nThere are two potential causes for this strange shift north, according to Karsten Haustein, a climate researcher at Leipzig University in Germany.\\nThe transition from El Niño to La Niña has influenced how far north this zone has moved this summer Haustein said. El Niño – a natural climate pattern marked by warmer than average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific – typically leads to drier than normal conditions in the wet portions of West and Central Africa. La Niña, or even a budding one, can have the opposite effect.\\nA warming world is the other significant factor.\\n'The Intertropical Convergence Zone, which is the reason for (Africa's) greening, moves farther north the warmer the world gets,' Haustein explained. 'At least, this is what most models suggest.'\\nA study published in the journal Nature this June found farther northward shifts in this zone could happen more frequently in the next couple decades as carbon dioxide – a byproduct of fossil fuel pollution – levels increase and the world warms.\\nA devastating sign of things to come\\nThe shift isn't just turning deserts green, it has disrupted the Atlantic hurricane season and had major consequences over the past few months for several African countries.\\nCountries that should be getting more rainfall are getting less as storms shift north. Parts of Nigeria and Cameroon typically get drenched with at least 20 to 30 inches of rain from July to September, but have only received between 50 and 80% of their typical rain since mid-July, according to CPC data.\\nFarther north, typically drier areas, including parts of Niger, Chad, Sudan, Libya and southern Egypt have received more than 400% of their typical rainfall since mid-July, according to CPC data.\\nTake the northern portion of Chad, which is part of the Sahara Desert. Only up to an inch of rain typically falls here from about mid-July to early September. But anywhere from 3 to 8 inches of rain has fallen in the same timeframe this year, according to CPC data.\\nThis excessive rainfall caused devastating flooding in Chad. Nearly 1.5 million people have been impacted and at least 340 have been killed by flooding in the country this summer, according to a United Nations briefing.\\nHorrific flooding has also killed more than 220 people and displaced hundreds of thousands in Nigeria, mainly in the typically drier northern portion of the country, CNN previously reported.\\nDeadly flooding also rocked Sudan in late August, killing at least 132 people and destroying more than 12,000 homes.\\nFlooding events like these likely have the fingerprints of climate change, according to Haustein, who works on attribution studies to determine to what extent climate change has influenced a particular weather event.\\nAs the world warms, it will be able to hold more moisture, Haustien explained. This could lead to wetter overall monsoons and more devastating flooding like this season.\\nMore research will be needed to determine just how much of role climate change played in each flooding event, but it could be a sign of things to come, Haustien said.\\n'Every single event is affected by climate change,' Haustein said. '(Even if) no single flood is (directly) caused by climate change, it has been made more likely.'\",\n",

[+] Art/Getty Images)\\nWorld War II did not just pick up from where World War I left off—it completely changed modern warfare, military strategies and the global order. The Treaty of Versailles and other unresolved issues from the First World War may have laid some foundation for the conflict, but the Second World War expanded its scope and left a lasting mark on international diplomacy, technology and human rights. Because of this impact, World War II has been memorialized in many works of literature and adaptations, including everything from war fiction and memoirs to biographies, military history and speculative fiction, inspiring writers across genres and countless war movies. Some of the most notable World War II works include William Shirer\\'s The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, Stephen Ambrose\\'s Band of Brothers, and Kristin Hannah\\'s The Nightingale. On this list, I have compiled 20 books that everyone should read to understand the world\\'s deadliest war better, and these rankings are based on public reception, cultural impact and longevity. Each work offers a different structure and understanding of a time in history and gives context to the experiences of those who lived through the war—soldiers on the front lines, civilians enduring the home front and leaders—whether visionary or Machiavellian— strategically tackling diplomatic challenges.\\nWorld War II is one of the most complicated wars in history and understanding the sheer scope of how the war affected people can feel understandably overwhelming. In this book, acclaimed American Civil War historian and academic Frank E. Vandiver breaks the complex pieces down into bite-sized chunks, giving readers a more straightforward way to comprehend parts of the war that changed the 20th century and continues to affect world order. Vandiver\\'s approach to this book is holistic, chronological and enriched with a global perspective that covers the war\\'s strategies, technologies and social influences.

After the Third Reich spread across Europe, Winston Churchill and his chief of staff came up with a controversial plan: to form a new commando unit made up of Jewish refugees who had escaped to Britain. This heroic unit, which would become known as X Troop, was composed of visionaries, artists, and athletes—many of whom had interned as enemy aliens. Garrett\\'s detailed research draws from extensive archival research, including declassified military documents, war diaries, and interviews with surviving members and their families adds a rich backdrop to this account.\\nWho should read this?: Readers who are interested in underreported World War II stories.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Harper Collins Publishers.\\nDunnigan and Nofi\\'s Dirty Little Secrets of World War II is an expose of the unknown secrets and strategies that informed the strategic decisions behind the war. The book primarily focuses on introduces snippets of information about the war called \"infobytes,\" which emphasize the lesser-known parts of the war. In writing this book, Dunnigan and Nofi also approach the Second World War from an interrogative perspective created to give readers a new outlook on the war, including high-tech inventions like electronic warfare and nuclear missiles. Overall, Dunnigan and Nofi\\'s collaboration contextualizes a lot of detail for the average reader in a way that conventional history books often overlook.\\nWho should read this?: This book is a good read for history buffs who want to have a deeper understanding of the war, especially those interested in the hidden strategies and technological innovations that influenced the outcome of the war.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Barnes & Noble.\\nRay Monk\\'s biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer gives insight into the keen mind of the mysterious, often caustic theoretical physicist and his role in The Manhattan Project, a research and development program undertaken during World War II that would produce the first nuclear weapons that would forever alter the 20th century. This memoir is not simply a flat retelling of historical facts; instead, it surveys the web of scientific ambition, ethical dilemma and personal affliction that defined Oppenheimer\\'s contribution to developing nuclear energy during and after World War II and the high stakes that came along with creating the atomic bomb. Monk\\'s A Life Inside The Center focuses on Oppenheimer\\'s internal conflict as a man proud of his scientific achievements but also struggling with the guilt of the atomic bomb\\'s consequences.\\nWho should read: Readers who are fascinated with brilliant protagonists battling with moral dilemmas and unintended consequences.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Penguin Random House.\\nFew leaders in the 20th century have conjured as much global condemnation as Adolf Hitler, and Ian Kershaw\\'s Hitler 1936-1945: Nemesis offers a paralleled view into Hitler, specifically from his most dictatorial years and ultimate demise. Kershaw\\'s inquiry into Hitler\\'s life offers a penetrating look into the damaging and tyrannical leadership of one of the most infamous dictators in history. But it\\'s not just Hitler under a microscope; in this book, the people around him who formed the baseline that allowed Hitler to claim power within Europe are examined, too, including the broader socio-political environment and the German public\\'s complicity.\\nWho should read: Readers who want to learn more about the unprecedented run of Europe\\'s most notorious dictator and the historical implications of his legacy.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Penguin Random House.\\nAndrew Roberts\\' Churchill: Walking with Destiny is a thoughtful biography of one of Britain\\'s most acclaimed political leaders and his impact on the Second World War.

By relying on a range of primary sources, Beevor, through prudent attention to detail, gives an authoritative interpretation of the execution and aftermath of the Normandy invasion and is praised for covering the event from its planning stages to the liberation of Paris. Beevor proves to be an effective storyteller by giving voice to soldiers from various nations and addressing the civilian toll, particularly on the French population. His attention to sensory detail—describing sights, sounds, and emotions—does more than narrate the true events of the brutal war; it immerses readers into the when and where of the war.\\nWho should read: War history buffs who enjoy books with detailed research and analysis will appreciate this book.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Penguin Random House.\\nUnited States Army Air Forces Eighth Air Force walk away from their aircraft after their bombing ...

The story is told from the perspective of the Henry family. It follows Victor \\'Pug\\' Henry, his wife, Rhoda, and their three grown children six months before Germany invades Poland in September 1939, and ends shortly after the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941. Wouk\\'s scaled combination of fiction and true-life events includes cameos from World War II leaders like Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin. While the novel touches on the military, diplomatic, and personal challenges of the time, it also connects to lesser-known details of intelligence work and operations influencing wartime strategies. The Henry family becomes the central part of the novel, helping Wouk to weave this story together using drama, romance and heroism. These combinations of well-known historical events and obscure details make Wouk\\'s perspective on World War II memorable.\\nWho should read: Enthusiasts who approve of historical narrations of events with a dose of fiction.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Hachette Book Group.\\nGuy Sajer\\'s The Forgotten Soldier is a powerful memoir that engages readers in the vanguard of the Eastern Front during World War II. Sajer, a French-German soldier, presents war as a struggle for survival, and he does so by describing the hunger, fatigue and constant deprivation that formed the core of his relationship with war. Some historians argue that the book leans towards a Roman à-clef—a novelized memoir—rather than a strictly factual account. However, many veterans and readers still consider it a valuable representation of the German soldier\\'s experience on the Eastern Front. Sajer noted the imperfections in his account but shared that he wrote The Forgotten Soldier based on his experience during a very stressful time and his recollection may not have been perfect.\\nWho should read: Readers interested in memoirs that narrate significant moments in history.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Barnes & Noble.\\nThe author of A Woman in Berlin was a mystery for over forty years. It wasn\\'t until 2003, after she died, that readers found out that Marta Hillers, a German journalist, wrote this gutting memoir. The book itself, a compilation of Hiller\\'s diary during the war, begins on Friday, 20 April 1945, Hitler\\'s 56th birthday, during a period when the Russian army was at the edge of Berlin. In this book, Hillers gives an honest perspective of the violence that she and many women faced in the aftermath of the war and their attempts at self-preservation despite the dangers they faced. Hillers\\' account of assaulted women, including herself, forming relationships with Soviet officers for protection shows just how the devastating toll of the war, especially on women, and her commentary is not just unvarnished; it is a brave account of the war\\'s civilian cost.\\nWho should read: Readers who are not afraid to read about memoirs about rare and unfiltered account\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Macmillan Publishers.\\nRick Atkinson\\'s Pulitzer-winning book An Army at Dawn: The War in North Africa, 1942–1943, is a well-researched literary review of the North African campaign during WWII. It is the first book in Atkinson\\'s Liberation Trilogy. The book takes readers on a journey back in time and analyzes the American army\\'s initial challenges and eventual triumphs as they powered through the challenges of Operation Torch and the difficult battles in Tunisia. Atkinson relies on first-hand resources like letters, personal diaries of soldiers and military documents to give every reader the most inverted account of the war possible. Atkinson points more than to the steep learning curve that the inexperienced American army faced; he also points to evolving cooperation among Allied forces. The account also focuses on the story\\'s human importance—the commanders and soldiers, their on-the-ground experiences and the challenges faced by key figures like Dwight D. Eisenhower and general George S. Patton Jr.\\nWho should read: Readers who are interested in understanding the strategic, tactical and operational aspects of the war.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Barnes & Noble.\\nAntony Beevor\\'s Stalingrad brings the brutal siege to life through interviews with survivors and military documents from both German and Soviet archives. Although the book touches on Operation Barbarossa, Germany\\'s invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, it zones in on the Battle of Stalingrad and the brutal combat, strategic moves and war crimes committed on both sides of the battle. Beevor also offers a backward look in time to August 1942, when Hitler\\'s Sixth Army reached the city, setting the stage for one of the war\\'s most dramatic turning points—the Soviet counteroffensive and eventual victory. Each chapter has a multi-layered depiction of the human suffering, starvation and brutality that defined the critical battle.\\nWho should read: This book is a valuable text for history students, specifically those interested in World War II, Soviet history or military strategy.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Penguin Random House.\\nAll the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr is a book that combines the stories of two young characters—Marie-Laure LeBlanc, a blind French girl, and Werner Pfennig, a German boy whose radio engineering talents gets him enlisted into the Nazi regime, where he uses his skills to locate and intercept illegal broadcasts from the French Resistance. This talent eventually led Werner to cross paths with Marie-Laure when his mission to track illegal radio broadcasts during the German occupation of France brought him to the coastal town of Saint-Malo. History fans have praised Doerr for his lyrical storytelling and nonlinear plot, which follows both protagonists in alternating chapters. Doerr\\'s depiction of the connection between the two protagonists, regardless of their different backgrounds, is a memorable contribution to fictional interpretations of the Second World War. This book is a brilliant addition to the literature of World War II and is one of the best fictional interpretations of the Second World War on this list.

Cornelius Ryan\\'s A Bridge Too Far is a seminal work on Operation Market Garden, one of the most ambitious yet ultimately failed military operations of World War II. Ryan\\'s relies on interviews with soldiers and civilians alike makes this a must-read for anyone looking to understand the complicated war operations. The operation, devised by British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, aimed to seize key bridges in Nazi-occupied Netherlands to create a path for an Allied invasion of Germany by Christmas 1944, and like several entries on this list, Ryan\\'s analysis probes into the strategic analysis with personal stories from soldiers and civilians. The operation, which combined airborne and ground forces, was supposed to capture five strategic bridges and it required precise coordination between British, American and Polish forces, but suffered from poor intelligence, logistical issues and unexpected German resistance. The failure to secure the final bridge at Arnhem—a \\'bridge too far\\'—caused the collapse of the mission.\\nWho should read: Readers interested in World War II history, particularly lesser-known but pivotal campaigns, A Bridge Too Far is a must-read.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Simon & Schuster.\\nStephen E.

The war, which would eventually push Louis to enlist in the United States Army Air Corps, where his story of grit and survival would form. After his plane getting shot down during the war, Louis would spend 47 days on a raft in the Pacific Ocean, and then be tortured mercilessly in Japanese POW camps. In this non-fictional body of work, Hillenbrand goes beyond merely recounting Louis\\' physical endurance; she incisively looks into his life after release—his struggles with faith, relationships, God and his path back to healing and inspiration.

In The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, Shirer suggests that some aspects of German national character, culture and history contributed to Hitler\\'s rise, but he does not solely attribute Hitler\\'s rise to these factors. His reporting in this book takes a chronological look at the rise and fall of Nazi Germany, beginning with Adolf Hitler\\'s birth and ending in World War II in Europe in 1945. His analysis dissects the political, social, and economic currents that pushed a nation into totalitarianism, along with the events and personalities that influenced that period.\\nWho should read: The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand the origins of a dictatorial regime that brought the world to the brink of destruction.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Simon & Schuster.\\nKristin Hannah\\'s The Nightingale is a tribute to the unsung heroines of World War II and a close follow-up to the inspiring story of two sisters in Nazi-occupied France.

Vianne, the more reclusive of the two sister decided to protect Jewish children by hiding them, while Isabelle, the more rebellious and stubborn sister, joined the French Resistance, a group of people who fought the Nazis and the Vichy regime in France during the Second World War.

(Photo by)\\nThanks to Joseph Heller, the term \\'Catch-22\\' has become a part of the global pop culture lexicon, which means any situation where contradictory rules or conditions trap a person. In this satire, Heller tells the story of Captain Yossarian, a frustrated bombardier stationed on a Mediterranean island during World War II, who becomes increasingly desperate to survive after he suspects the military is trying to kill him. The novel is not just brilliant because of its absurdity; its dark humor and philosophical themes within the story create a plot that is both hilarious and unsettling. Heller\\'s description of the bureaucratic nature of military life is spot-on, while his sharp critique of war and authority resonates with many people. Because of this, this book has become a cornerstone of modern literature and one that continues to challenge, entertain and encourage conversation.\\nWho should read: People who enjoy fictional works that tackle serious topics through biting satire.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Simon & Schuster.\\nKurt Vonnegut\\'s Slaughterhouse-Five is more than just an anti-war American classic novel; it follows the fractured lens of Billy Pilgrim, a barber\\'s son, turned drafted soldier who becomes \\'unstuck in time,\" especially after surviving the apocalyptic firebombing of Dresden. In this novel, Vonnegut defies linear storytelling, much like the chaotic nature of war itself, to follow Billy\\'s disorienting journey through time and space as a reflection of the randomness and unpredictability that life—and war—imposes. Vonnegut repeatedly juxtaposes the real-life horrors of war with moments of dark humor to create an unconventional depiction of the war, which is inspired by Vonnegut\\'s own experiences as a prisoner of war in Dresden during World War II.\\nWho should read: Readers who have a taste for dark, satirical humor will find that Slaughterhouse-Five consistently delivers.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Penguin Random House.\\nMany World War II books, fictional or not, have become important heirlooms of moments in time offering different generations of readers insight into one of the most devastating conflicts in human history.

       "   'summary': \"Equity markets were up smartly for the week ended September 13 with three of the four major averages up between 4% and 6% (see table). Only the Dow Jones lagged (+2.60%), mainly for wont of a high concentration of tech names. Normally, that 2.60% rise would make investors ecstatic.\\nEquity Markets\\nAs usual, tech led the way. Nvidia (NVDA), closing at $119.08, advanced nearly 16% for the week, and has made up nearly all of September's falloff. It is now within striking distance of its August 23rd peak closing price ($129.37). The rest of the Magnificent 7 advanced between 4% and 10%, except for Apple (AAPL) which is still suffering from disappointing investors at its recently held quarterly meeting.\\nMagnificent 7\\nOn the fixed income side, yields continued to soften with the 10-Year Treasury yield now at 3.66%\\n10 Year Treasury Yield\\nThe latest Consumer Price Index came out on Wednesday (September 11th) for August, and it showed that inflation continued on its downward path. The overall index rose just +0.2% for the month and 2.5% from a year ago, the lowest that annual number has been since all the way back to February of 2021 – that's 3.5 years ago!\\nThe 'core' rate of inflation which excludes food and energy, and the index followed closely by Federal Reserve policymakers – that rose 0.3% in August and 3.2% on a year-over-year basis. And that 3.2% number was tied for the lowest level since April of 2021.\\nU.S. consumer price index\\nTo show the progress on inflation, looking only at the last three months and annualizing those numbers puts the headline number at +1.1%, and the core at 2.1%. In our weekly blogs, we have discussed the computational issue that is part and parcel of the construction of the consumer price index. The issue there is that the shelter component (mostly rents) which has a large 36% weighting in the index, is lagged. That means the data is not current, and, in fact, the rent data used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to construct the index, is 9-12 months old. An up-to-date rent index, like the Apartment List Index, shows that, on a national basis, rents have actually fallen -0.7% over the year ending in August.\\nSo, if we exclude those old rents from the Consumer Price Index, that index behaved quite well: 0.0% in August, 0.0% in July, and -0.2% in both June and May. And remember, current rents are falling, so if they were included, we would actually be seeing deflation.\\nFor some reason or other, and despite the fact that the last 3-month trend is what is most likely to continue in the near future, markets like to look at year-over-year comparisons. So, looked at from this perspective (year-over-year), if we exclude rents, the Consumer Price Index was flat (0.0%) for the two months July and August and rose just +1.1% from a year earlier. In July, that number was +1.7%. So, you can see just how rapidly inflation is subsiding. Virtually all the rise in the CPI ln August was due to the rise in insurance premiums and to shelter costs. The insurance premiums are a one-time catch-up phenomenon, and the rise in the shelter component is from the lagged data used by BLS as discussed earlier. (Shelter costs, as noted, are actually falling.) The prices of goods, on net, are flat to down.\\nYoY Change in National Rent Index (2019 - Present)\\nMeanwhile, the Fed is about to make its first mini-move to lower historically restrictive interest rates. Because I think the Fed is 'late to the party' or 'behind the curve' in easing monetary policy (let's not forget that there is a long lag between when the Fed implements monetary policy changes and the impact of those changes on the economy), I expect that the disinflation we have seen so far (i.e., slower price increases) will actually become deflation (i.e. actual lower prices) by year's end. We've already begun to see this in prices at the gas pump.\\nTo reiterate: the inflation genie has been put back into the bottle as inflation is now effectively at the Fed's 2% goal. Meanwhile, the Fed is about to take its first baby step, a 25 or perhaps 50 basis point rate reduction, toward easing its historically restrictive monetary policy. In our view, the Fed is 'behind the curve,' and that is why we believe that a bout of deflation, i.e., falling prices, lies ahead.\\nAverage Gasoline Pries Fell -4.5% During August; Online Grocery Prices Fall by the Most in August\\nThe two charts above show just how deflationary August really was. The price of gas declined about -8% during the month, while the prices of online groceries were down nearly -4%.\\nMeanwhile, consumers have begun to tighten their purse strings. In the Q2 earnings reports of major retailers, CEO commentary was unanimous in reporting that consumers had begun to pull back. While they continued to spend on essentials/necessities, they reduced outlays on discretionary items, now looking for bargains.\\nThe Fed's Beige Book assesses current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. It characterizes regional economic conditions based on information gathered directly from businesses. Here is a sample of comments from the August Book, published on Wednesday, September 4th.\\nSample of comments from the August Book\\nContinuing with the plight of the consumer, in the housing industry, mortgage purchase applications have fallen to 30-year lows despite the fall in mortgage rates from 7.9% last October to 6.3% in August (a 160-basis point decline). Given Fed Chair Powell's announcement at the Fed's Jackson Hole symposium that the Fed would begin to lower rates in September, perhaps potential homebuyers, or those trading up or down, are waiting for mortgage rates to fall even further.\\nMortgage Purchase Applications\\nIn past blogs we've discussed the rising trend in credit card and auto loan delinquencies. Along this line of thought, the NY Fed does a survey of consumer attitudes and expectations. Two concerning trends have emerged as shown in the following chart: 1) the rise in consumer expectations that they will become delinquent on a debt payment in the next three months; and 2) the upward trend in the probability of losing a job.\\nDebt Delinquency Expected Over Next 3 Months; Probability of Losing a Job\\nGoing back to last week's jobs report, the sister to the Establishment Survey Payroll Report, the Household Survey reported that -438K full-time jobs were lost in August, but they were replaced by +527K part-time jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics counts full-time and part-time jobs as the same (i.e., each equal to one job). In our view, a more realistic approach is to count a part-time job as equal to one-half of a full-time position. Using this approach, the +527K part-time jobs become the equivalent of +263K full-time. So, the loss of -438K full-time jobs was only partially offset by the +263K jobs attributable as full-time. That's a net loss of -175K full-time jobs. So, it isn't a wonder to us why the Fed's Beige Book carried so many negatives on consumer spending, why auto and credit card delinquencies are on the rise, and why consumer worries about losing a job and missing a debt payment are on upward trends. On a side note, PwC announced layoffs of 1,800 employees, the first job cuts for that company since '09. (Wait a minute! Wasn't '09 part of the Great Recession?)\\nThe rest of the world, too, is slowing down. This past week, the European Central Bank (ECB) lowered its reference rate by -25 basis points to 3.50% (note that the Fed, at 5.25%, is way behind the curve) in response to economic softness in Euroland, especially in Germany, where Industrial Production fell a whopping -2.4% in July, and their Manufacturing PMI fell to 42.4 (below 50 means contraction). We also note that Volkswagen (VW) announced layoffs, breaking a three-decade security pact with its German employees.\\nAnd then there is China which remains deeply in Recession. Property values have melted. Consumers had been using home equity appreciation to finance consumption, but that source has now dried up. As a result, the government has moved interest rates lower in an effort to spur economic growth. But there, like here, there is a long lag between a policy action and its impact on the economy.\\nThe CPI and PPI reports were in line with market expectations and were the last inflation reports before the Fed's imminent meeting (September 17-18). At the August Jackson Hole conclave, Chairman Powell indicated that the Fed would be loosening policy restraints, code for lowering the Fed Funds Rate. Since then, the financial community has debated how large the first rate cut will be, i.e., -25 or -50 basis points. Our view is that the rate cut will be -25 basis points. The reason: a -50 basis point cut would spook financial markets, giving them concern that the Fed sees something more sinister than a 'soft-landing.'\\nFinancial markets continue to march higher, mostly in anticipation of the beginning of a Fed easing cycle and the prospect of an economic 'soft-landing.' A -25 basis point reduction in the Fed Funds Rate is what is currently expected, and markets will likely continue to rise unless the language of the Fed statement and/or Chairman Powell's post-meeting press conference paint a different picture (unlikely). A -50 basis point reduction would send a message to the financial markets that the Fed sees the economy slowing too fast, and that would cause a drawdown in those markets.\\nThe inflation data was benign with some emerging deflationary characteristics, like rapidly falling gasoline and grocery prices. And the Fed's own Beige Book was nothing more than a compendium of emerging softness in consumption. Such softness can be seen in the fall of mortgage purchase applications to 30-year lows despite falling mortgage rates. In addition, there is growing consumer concern over job security and their ability to service their existing debts.\\nFurther, despite the hyped jobs headline (+142K), deeper analysis shows that full-time jobs are evaporating, being replaced by part-time ones. While the BLS counts full-time and part-time jobs as equal, a more reasonable approach, counting part-time as half a full-time job, leads to the conclusion that the job market has weakened considerably.\\nEconomic growth in the rest of the world has slowed. Germany looks Recessionary. The European Central Bank just lowered their reference rate by -25 basis points to 3.50%. China's economy remains in a downturn.\\nAt its imminent September meeting, the Fed is expected to lower rates by -25 basis points. If they lowered by -50-basis points, that would send a message to financial markets that the Fed sees the economy slowing too fast. Because the Fed knows this would play havoc with the equity market, it is quite unlikely to occur.\\n(Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.)\",\n",

U.S.-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles would enhance that capability, but they are too costly and limited in number to reshape the dynamic, they said.\\nMoreover, the Kremlin has largely moved perhaps the most immediate threat -- Russian warplanes launching glide bombs -- beyond the range of the U.S. missiles, the U.S. officials said.\\nThey also believe Kyiv should focus on halting a Russian advance in Ukraine\\'s east.\\nFor Biden, the decision is not just tactical. It raises questions about whether authorizing such strikes might risk a direct war between NATO and Russia.\\nRussia warned at the United Nations on Friday that authorizing Ukraine to fire missiles far into Russia would turn NATO into \"a direct party to hostilities against a nuclear power,\" and Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that such a move would alter the scope of the conflict.\\nWhite House spokesman John Kirby said on Friday the United States took such threats seriously, even as he acknowledged there was nothing new in Putin\\'s rhetoric.\\nDemocratic U.S. Representative Jason Crow, a member of the House intelligence and foreign affairs committees, downplayed the threat of Putin attacking Poland or other NATO members in retaliation.\\n\"I don\\'t believe there\\'s any indication that Vladimir Putin has an interest in picking a fight with NATO,\" he told Reuters, pointing to Russia\\'s massive losses of men and armor in Ukraine. \"To the contrary, I think he is avoiding a NATO confrontation.\"\\nSpeaking at Ramstein Air Base in Germany a week ago, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the United States and its allies to ignore Russia\\'s red lines and give permission for long-range strikes into Russia as a way to pressure Moscow.\\n\"We need to have this long-range capability not only on the occupied territory of Ukraine, but also on Russian territory ... so that Russia is motivated to seek peace,\" Zelenskiy said.\\nTwo European diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Ukraine has submitted to the U.S. and Britain a list of potential targets inside Russia that could be hit if allowed.\\nThe discussion about whether to ease restrictions on Ukraine echoes prior debates about Kyiv\\'s pleas for other capabilities it hoped would give it an edge against Russian forces, from F-16 fighter jets to Abrams tanks.\\n\"You\\'ve heard this (debate) before,\" said one U.S. official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity.\\nUkrainians initially wanted to use U.S.-supplied ATACMS long-range missiles to hit Russian airbases, officials said.\\nBut the Pentagon has said 90% of Russian aircraft launching glide bombs, one of the top threats for Ukraine, are at airfields at least 300 kilometers (186 miles) away from Ukrainian-controlled territory.

It raises questions about whether authorizing such strikes might risk a direct war between NATO and Russia.\\nRussia warned at the United Nations on Friday that authorizing Ukraine to fire missiles far into Russia would turn NATO into \"a direct party to hostilities against a nuclear power,\" and Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that such a move would alter the scope of the conflict.\\nWhite House spokesman John Kirby said on Friday the United States took such threats seriously, even as he acknowledged there was nothing new in Putin\\'s rhetoric.\\nDemocratic U.S. Representative Jason Crow, a member of the House intelligence and foreign affairs committees, downplayed the threat of Putin attacking Poland or other NATO members in retaliation.\\n\"I don\\'t believe there\\'s any indication that Vladimir Putin has an interest in picking a fight with NATO,\" he told Reuters, pointing to Russia\\'s massive losses of men and armor in Ukraine. \"To the contrary, I think he is avoiding a NATO confrontation.\"\\nWHAT WOULD UKRAINE STRIKE IN RUSSIA?\\nSpeaking at Ramstein Air Base in Germany a week ago, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the United States and its allies to ignore Russia\\'s red lines and give permission for long-range strikes into Russia as a way to pressure Moscow.\\n\"We need to have this long-range capability not only on the occupied territory of Ukraine, but also on Russian territory ... so that Russia is motivated to seek peace,\" Zelenskiy said.\\nTwo European diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Ukraine has submitted to the U.S. and Britain a list of potential targets inside Russia that could be hit if allowed.\\nThe discussion about whether to ease restrictions on Ukraine echoes prior debates about Kyiv\\'s pleas for other capabilities it hoped would give it an edge against Russian forces, from F-16 fighter jets to Abrams tanks.\\n\"You\\'ve heard this (debate) before,\" said one U.S. official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity.\\nUkrainians initially wanted to use U.S.-supplied ATACMS long-range missiles to hit Russian airbases, officials said.\\nBut the Pentagon has said 90% of Russian aircraft launching glide bombs, one of the top threats for Ukraine, are at airfields at least 300 kilometers (186 miles) away from Ukrainian-controlled territory. That puts them out of range of the ATACMS.\\nUkraine now wants to use the missiles to strike Russian military command and control hubs, fuel and weapons depots and troop concentrations, officials said.\\nIn addition to U.S. ATACMS, Kyiv wants to carry out long-range strikes into Russia using Storm Shadow missiles provided by Britain and the nearly identical French SCALP missiles.\\nAlthough Britain is expected to seek U.S. approval before lifting its restrictions on Storm Shadow missiles, a French diplomatic source said Paris did not need authorization from Washington for Ukraine to use French missiles.\\nFOCUS ON GROUND WAR\\nAnother U.S. concern is that focusing on long-range strikes downplays what could be a bigger immediate threat: Russia\\'s advances on the ground inside Ukrainian territory toward the strategic city of Pokrovsk. U.S. officials believe the loss of the city would deal a significant blow.\\nAnalysts said Russia has many response options, short of direct war with NATO, if the United States or its allies allow Ukraine to unleash strikes deep into Russia.\\nIn June, Putin spoke of possibly arming the West\\'s enemies with Russian weapons to strike Western targets abroad, and of deploying conventional missiles within striking distance of the United States and its European allies.\\nUlrich Kuehn, an arms expert at the Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy in Hamburg, said he did not rule out Putin choosing to send some kind of nuclear message - for example testing a nuclear weapon in an effort to cow the West.\\nStill, Crow, the U.S. lawmaker, argued that Putin was in a weaker position after the Ukraine invasion, and any major response from Moscow created risks for him.\\n\"Vladimir Putin is not 10-feet tall. We have seen that repeatedly over the last couple of years. He\\'s very vulnerable, and frankly, he\\'s in a position of significant weakness,\\' said Crow.\\n(Additional reporting by John Irish in Paris, Elizabeth Piper, Mark Trevelyan and Andrew Osborn in London; Editing by Don Durfee and Cynthia Osterman)',\n",

       "   'summary': 'When school started this year for Mikalay in Belarus, the 15-year-old discovered that his teachers and administrators no longer called him by that name. Instead, they referred to him as Nikolai, its Russian equivalent.\\nWhat\\'s more, classes at his school — one of the country\\'s best — are now taught in Russian, not Belarusian, which he has spoken for most of his life.\\nBelarusians like Mikalay are experiencing a new wave of Russification as Moscow expands its economic, political and cultural dominance to overtake the identity of its neighbour.\\nThis isn\\'t unprecedented. During the czarist and Soviet eras, Russia imposed its language, symbols, and cultural institutions on Belarus. However, after the USSR dissolved in 1991, Belarus began to reclaim its identity. Belarusian briefly became the official language, and the white-red-white national flag replaced the Soviet-era red hammer and sickle.\\nThe situation shifted in 1994 when Alexander Lukashenko, a former Soviet collective farm official, came to power. He made Russian an official language alongside Belarusian and removed the nationalist symbols.\\nNow, with Lukashenko in power for over three decades, he has permitted Russia to dominate various aspects of life in Belarus, a nation of 9.5 million. Belarusian is rarely heard on the streets of Minsk and other large cities. Official business is conducted in Russian, which also dominates the media. Lukashenko speaks only Russian, and government officials often avoid using Belarusian.\\nThe country relies on Russian loans and cheap energy, forming a political and military alliance with Moscow. This alliance allows President Vladimir Putin to station troops and missiles in Belarus, using it as a staging area for the war in Ukraine.\\n\\'I understand that our Belarus is occupied. … And who is the president there? Not Lukashenko. The president is Putin,\\' said Svetlana Alexievich, the 2015 Nobel Prize in Literature winner, who lives in Germany in effective exile. \\'The nation has been humiliated and it will be very difficult for Belarusians to recover from this.\\'\\nBelarusian cultural figures have faced persecution, and hundreds of nationalist organisations have been shut down. Experts suggest that Moscow aims to implement in Belarus what it intended for Ukraine when the war there began in 2022.\\n\\'It is obvious that our children are being deliberately deprived of their native language, history, and Belarusian identity, but parents have been strongly advised not to ask questions about Russification,\\' said Anatoly, father of a Belarusian student, speaking on condition of anonymity due to fear of retribution.\\n\\'We were informed about the synchronisation of the curriculum with Russia this year and were shown a propaganda film about how the Ukrainian special services are allegedly recruiting our teenagers and forcing them to commit sabotage in Belarus,\\' he added.\\nOnly a few schools have managed to retain some paperwork and courses in Belarusian. In recent years, one of these schools saw dozens of its teachers fired, and the Belarusian-language section of its website disappeared.\\nLukashenko derides his native language, stating, \\'Nothing great can be expressed in Belarusian. … There are only two great languages in the world: Russian and English.\\'\\nBelarus was part of the Russian empire for centuries and became one of the 15 Soviet republics after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. Daily use of Belarusian decreased and continued only in the country\\'s west, north, and rural areas.\\nIn 1994, about 40% of students were taught in Belarusian; now, it\\'s under 9%. Speaking Belarusian is seen as opposition to Lukashenko and a declaration of national identity, which played a key role in the mass protests after the disputed 2020 election that gave Lukashenko a sixth term. In the harsh crackdown that followed, half a million people fled the country.\\nAt the same time, \\'more people want to speak Belarusian, which has become one of the symbols of freedom, but they\\'re afraid to do it in public,\\' said Alina Nahornaja, author of \\'Language 404,\\' a book about Belarusians who faced discrimination for speaking their native language.\\nLike Ukrainians, Belarusians desired closer ties with Europe, accompanying their nationalist sentiment, noted Belarusian analyst Valery Karbalevich. \\'But the Kremlin quickly realised the danger and began the process of creeping Russification in Belarus,\\' he added.\\nThis led to the emergence of pro-Russian organisations, joint educational programmes, and cultural projects, \\'like mushrooms after the rain — against the backdrop of harsh repressions against everything Belarusian,\\' Karbalevich said.\\nCensorship and bans affect not only contemporary Belarusian literature but also its classics. In 2023, the prosecutor\\'s office declared extremist the 19th-century poems of Vincent Dunin-Martsinkyevich, who opposed the Russian Empire.\\nWhen the Kremlin supported Lukashenko against the anti-government protests in 2020, it ensured his loyalty and received carte blanche in Belarus.\\n\\'Today, Lukashenko is paying Putin with our sovereignty,\\' said exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. \\'Belarusian national identity, cultures, and language are our strongest weapons against the Russian world and Russification.\\'\\nIn February she had posted on X that \"being labeled as \\'extremist\\' means loving your country & speaking your language.\"\\nFour cities in Belarus now host a \\'Russia House\\' to promote Russian culture and influence, offering seminars, film clubs, exhibitions, and competitions.\\n\\'The goal is to plant Russian narratives so that as many Belarusians as possible view Russian as their own,\\' said analyst Alexander Friedman. \\'The Kremlin spares no expense and acts on a grand scale, which could be especially effective and dangerous in a situation where Belarus has found itself in information isolation, and there is almost no one left inside the country to resist the Russian world.\\'\\n\\'Putin published an article denying the existence of an independent Ukraine back in 2021, and even then we understood perfectly well that he was pursuing similar goals in Belarus,\" Latushka said.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is being linked once again with an explosive cross-city transfer to Manchester City amid claims the player has been struggling with 'bullying' from club legends and former players.\\nThe Red Devils squeaked a win in their Premier League opener against Fulham but have since lost successive matches to Brighton and Liverpool, ramping up the early pressure on Erik ten Hag. And while Manchester United will expect a major improvement on last season's eighth-placed finish – their all-time worst finish in the Premier League era – they go into this weekend's round of matches sat in a lowly 14th place.\\nOne player Ten Hag will be hoping to get the best of is Rashford, who scored a hugely-impressive 30 goals in Ten Hag's first season at the club, but then saw his form badly dip in the 2023/24 campaign, ultimately costing him his place in England's European Championships squad.\\nSo far this season, Rashford has yet to contribute a goal or an assist from three appearances – and Ten Hag will be concerned he is yet to show his best.\\nAnd with El Nacional reporting that Rashford is open to performing the 'ultimate betrayal' by signing for Manchester City next year, claims of his unhappiness with life at Manchester United have taken a shock new downturn amid a claim by the i paper that the 26-year-old feels he is being 'bullied' by a bunch of the club's former players.\\nCiting a source from within United's academy, the i claims that those close to Rashford now see the 'onslaught' as 'bullying' from some ex-players and legends.\\n'When someone else misplaces a pass it does not get mentioned, but when it is Marcus it's different,' one source told i.\\nREAD MORE Alan Shearer returns fire in war of words with Erik ten Hag over Marcus Rashford\\nThe report continued: 'Very different. The criticism coming his way is an onslaught. It is bullying. Supporters believe what senior ex-players say, which only makes worse.\\n'The club have spent £100m on central strikers and Marcus is back out wide, as a facilitator. And he is doing his job in that regard. It isn't his fault the chances aren't being put away.'\\nThe i claims Rashford has undergone a period of intense personal training during the international break in a sign that the player still believes he can succeed at the highest level and regain his place in the England squad and despite some of the club's former stars having their own doubts.\\nAmong those condemning his displays has been Gary Neville, who admitted after the Liverpool game that he has been 'sad' watching Rashford's performances over the previous 14 months.\\n'He had a one-on-one with Konate. And you might not be having a great day. You might not be having a great time.\\n'But you've still got to go for it and take the one-on-one on. And he just turned back. That just tells you where his head at.\\n'I'd like to think [he can get back to his best]. It's been going on for 14 months. He scored 30 goals the season before last. I'd like to think he can get his confidence back.\\n'It's looking like a struggle for him. The game doesn't look enjoyable right now. And that's sad. As it is for seeing Casemiro in the first half, it's sad watching that kid because he has been a joy for Manchester United at times in his career.\\n'But it's getting hard work for him. And it's getting hard for Manchester United fans to watch him.'\\nMeanwhile, another star who failed to show his best while at United, Donny van de Beek, has come clean on his struggles while at Old Trafford.\\nThe Dutchman was an initial £35m signing by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in the delayed summer 2020 transfer window, but rarely showed anywhere near the form expected of him and he departed in a lowly up front fee of just €500,000 (£420,000 / $555,000) to Girona this summer.\\n'I think it's clear that it didn't work out for both sides,' Van de Beek said in an extended interview.\\n'But that's the past and I have nothing bad to say about the club.'\\nElsewhere today, Bayern Munich star Jamal Musiala has insisted he was only 'joking' when suggesting he had discussed a future move to Old Trafford with his former teammate and current Red Devils star Joshua Zirkzee.\\nAnd while the two men played together at Bayern, the prospects of the 21-year-old Germany playmaker being lured away look bleak in the face of a big declaration on his new deal by the Bundesliga giants.\\nAt his very best there is no doubting that Rashford is one of the very best around and his qualities are there for all to see.\\nHowever, as his statistics show, his form has been extremely up and down over the years and the player that was evident in the 2022/23 campaign appears to have been lost within him.\\nHe has had peaks and troughs before, bouncing back superbly in that first season under Ten Hag from where he had been the year previously.\\nMarcus Rashford Man Utd stats\\nOverall, the player boasts 136 goals and 69 assists from 420 appearances at the time of writing, giving him a goal contribution every 2.048 times he has appeared for the club.\\nAnd while that record is not to be sniffed at and underlines his very obvious qualities, it would be terrifying to think what those numbers would look like if he were to have produced his very best year-in, year-out.\\nDON'T MISS Arne Slot 'connection' cited as Liverpool rival Man City for €80m star who 'vetoed' Man Utd move\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'Wine sommelier Alisha Blackwell-Calvert shares expert tips seasonal wine pairings, menu ideas and creating a cozy atmosphere.',\n",
       "   'summary': 'To ensure your gathering is both elegant and enjoyable, expert advice can make all the difference.\\nCooler months are approaching, but that doesn\\'t mean social gatherings are slowing down. If anything, the holiday season will be here before you know it, and the social calendar will be full.\\nPlanning a memorable event can be excessively stressful at times, but with a little guidance and research, you can put together a menu worth of a top chef or sommelier.\\n\"Providing variety in wine styles is the best way to accommodate varying preferences at dinner parties,\\' says Alisha Blackwell-Calvert, an award-winning advanced sommelier and beverage director of the new Italian-American restaurant Madrina in St. Louis. \\'Focus on providing popular varieties to ensure there is something for everyone.\\'\\nSpecifically, Blackwell-Calvert suggests pinot grigio and oaked chardonnay for whites then pinot noir and cabernet sauvignon for reds. \\'These varieties are on opposite ends of their respective spectrums,\\' she explains. \\'Having a sweeter option like moscato, brachetto or a kabinett-level riesling will guarantee a glass for every palate.\"\\nMaribel Lieberman, owner of New York chocolate boutique MarieBelle and author of coffee table book MarieBelle Entertains, says dining should be an elevated and enjoyable experience.\\n\\'Pairing each course with a wine makes the meal even more memorable,\\' Lieberman tells Forbes. \\'I enjoy creating dishes and combining ingredients based on taste, texture and color. I believe that the right wine pairing makes or breaks the experience of the meal. While I pair each course with a wine that I think will bring out the flavor and experience of the dish, I think it\\'s important to have versatile and alternative offerings for those who may prefer something else.\\'\\nWith that in mind, here are some some expert tips on how to create a wine-focused dinner party menu at home like a pro for three different types of festive gatherings.\\nWines that are enjoyed outside should be refreshing, notes Blackwell-Calvert. And serving temperature is important in wine service, so be cautious while enjoying wine outside in hot temperatures.\\n\"When pairing wines for lighter, seasonal dishes for an outdoor gathering, I would recommend crisp whites like sauvignon blanc and riesling or reds from low-tannin varieties that can withstand a chill like those produced from gamay or pinot noir,\\' Blackwell-Calvert says. \\'Highly tannic, full-bodied wines like a powerful cabernet sauvignon may seem too bitter and boozy to compliment summer\\'s more delicate food offerings if served at hot outdoor temperatures.\"\\nFor Courtney Storer, culinary producer of the Emmy-winning series, The Bear, her approach to cooking focuses on using seasonal and locally sourced ingredients. Admittedly, she says, this works really well year-round in Los Angeles (as seen through a dinner party she recently worked on for Miraval Rosé, but stresses you can easily follow this advice from anywhere in the U.S. to prepare simple yet flavorful dishes that highlight the natural tastes and textures in the ingredients.\\n\\'Less is more. It\\'s a common French approach in cooking and in life,\\' Storer tells Forbes. Instead of a formal dinner, make a grazing style table with your favorite dishes. Create a laid-back tablescape that is elegant by not overthinking it. I like to use a few extra items I\\'m featuring on my menu as part of the table décor. Some extra fruit, vegetables and bread that are part of your meal will look great as décor in baskets or platters.\\'\\nWinter pairings can sometimes be tricky due to the season\\'s heavier comfort foods.\\n\\'To not overwhelm the palate with pairings, a well-made red or white that has a balance of acidity is crucial,\\' Blackwell-Calvert says. \\'Acid will prevent both the wine and the food from overloading your tastebuds. The chosen grape variety isn\\'t as important as the quality of the wine itself.\\'\\nIn general, winter is the perfect season to enjoy bold reds, she notes.\\n\\'The jammy fruit and spice characters of these styles are great flavor accompaniments to hearty food,\\' Blackwell-Calvert says. \\'Look for wines made from montepulciano, primitivo, carmenere or petite sirah as outside the box choices that pair wonderfully with traditional holiday flavors.\"\\nFor creating a memorable wine dinner party experience, presentation plays a vital role. Take into account the type of glassware, plateware and silverware.\\nFor a plated dinner, Blackwell-Calvert says, ensure that the next course\\'s wine is in the glass just before the food arrives. It will give the guests time to prime their palates for the next pairing. For a buffet-style event, make sure wine is easily accessible and easy to serve.\\n\\'My front-of-house experience made me a firm believer that wine is a major part of curating culinary experiences,\\' Storer notes. \\'I\\'ve always been more drawn to wines that help break the ice, bottles that tell a story and make people feel comfortable while still offering a sense of finesse.\\'\\nPro tip: \\'For wine on ice in a self-service environment, leave a serviette or linen cloth at the ice station for guests to wipe bottles while handling and to help keep their hands dry,\\' Blackwell-Calvert says. \\'Details matter and supplying everything a guest may possibly need will add a \\'wow\\' factor to the experience.\"\\nThere is a common misconception that bubbles are only for special occasions or holidays, like anniversaries or New Year\\'s Eve. But really, sparkling wine can be enjoyed year-round, regardless of date or the temperature outside. (That said, of course the temperature of the bottle should always be chilled.)\\n\\'A great wine doesn\\'t have to be a stuffy or overly expensive,\\' Storer notes.\\n\\'Sparkling wines enhance the flavor and experience of the dishes and the experience of the meal,\\' adds Lieberman. \\'My favorite sparkling wine is champagne blanc de blancs brut nature—an elegant, refined sparkling wine with a crisp, clean taste and delicate bubbles. This sophisticated wine pairs beautifully with extravagant dishes such as lobster and caviar. Additionally, it complements lighter dishes like scallops and oysters or salmon tartare.\\'\\nAlternatively, Lieberman continues, a sparkling shiraz or lambrusco can add an exciting twist to pasta and white meat dishes, creating a delightful contrast of flavors and textures.\\nAll that said, sparkling wine—such as crémant made in France or sekt in Germany and Austria—should always be included when you want to celebrate a bit extra. Champagne is the most famous style, certainly, but sparkling wine is produced in a range of styles and sweetness levels.\\n\\'Bubbles are refreshing for the palate and an enjoyable drinking experience that awakens the senses and makes you smile,\\' Blackwell-Calvert says. \\'For truly special occasions, choose premium sparkling wine styles labeled brut or extra brut as the residual sugar levels are the most versatile with a wide range of food types—not too sweet nor astringently dry for most guests.\\'',\n",

       "   'excerpt': \"The Stirling prize-winning duo's new St Pancras Campus of homes and offices in London is a triumph of attention to detail. It could also be their last new-build, they tell us, as they focus on…\",\n",
       "   'summary': \"Many architects like to say that they practise attention to detail. (As, you may say, they should.) Sometimes this statement is a form of faint self-praise, a signal not to expect too much more from their work, an excuse for being a bit dull. Not so with Adam Caruso and Peter St John. 'We spend a lot of time on the detail,' says the latter. 'That's what we enjoy and that's what we expect every project to have.' But their preoccupation is not dutiful. It's what makes their projects zing. It makes the spaces they design richer and curiouser than they would otherwise be. If you experience a kind of heightened attention in their architecture, that's because they put it there.\\nTheir attitude has, over the past 34 years, made their practice, Caruso St John, one of the best of their generation. It has also led them to be somewhat estranged from the land where they set up their business, Britain, whose commercial culture is not always conducive to subtlety and care. 'Developers are too powerful in this country,' says Caruso (who is Canadian), 'and everything is deliberately upped in terms of crudity and brashness.' The duo, who have offices in London and Zurich, have thrived better in continental European nations – Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and France – where city planners use 'proper competition systems' to raise the quality of architecture.\\nIn Britain, Caruso St John tend to get confined to niches, such as work for Oxbridge colleges and with historic and artistic buildings, 'where people really care about how buildings are built'. Here, they won the Stirling prize in 2016 with their Newport Street Gallery in south London, a conversion of listed industrial buildings for Damien Hirst. In other countries they are entrusted with large office and apartment buildings – the places, that is to say, where many of us spend most of our lives.\\nIt is only now that they are completing their first such development in the UK, the 24,000 sq metre, £101m St Pancras Campus, London. It's also 'probably the last', says Caruso. Like many architects, they want to minimise the carbon emissions that come with new building and wherever possible reuse old ones. In their recent Royale Belge project, for example, they opened up a 1970s office block in Brussels to public use with a dramatic circulating space cut out of its centre.\\nThe St Pancras Campus is on a site formerly of industrial sheds in a zone where the building boom of the King's Cross area encounters the quieter residential streets of the borough of Camden – terraces that retain some of the dusty aura of the films that were shot around here in the days when this area still embodied urban grit. There's a canal nearby and remnants of manufacturing. There are collisions of scales and histories, of which Caruso St John's design seeks to make sense. The new development, they say, is 'arguably too big for its site', so they have put 'a lot of energy' into breaking up its bulk.\\nThanks in part to the influence of the borough of Camden's planners, the project is not a monolithic office building but a city block, a place of several uses and social groups, gathered around shared spaces that are accessible to everyone. It has flats, both for social and market rent, some retail, and as much new industrial space as was demolished. A broad route crosses the site, with a lush little garden by Jonathan Cook Landscape Architects in its centre and a covered street serving the workshops running off to one side. The office lobby, a muscular space of steel columns and beams, is available to the public, and comes with a cafe attached. This is the kind of city-making that architects dream of but don't often achieve: an array of compressed and generous spaces with the multiplicity and openness of beloved towns from the past.\\nThe whole is unified by the design of the fabric and facades, with a palette of reddish stone and white concrete that echoes the brick and stucco of the neighbouring houses. A gridded pattern is applied to both offices and homes, but with changes in scale and treatment to reflect their different uses. It is enriched with touches of material pleasure – glazed green bricks that glisten in the shadowy parts of the complex, and rough, corduroy-like fluting on one face of the otherwise smooth pillars. The architects enjoy playing with the apparent substance of the construction; sometimes it looks like pure surface, as flat as can be, at other times carved and solid.\\nTheir attention to detail extends inside, even to the interiors of the lifts, and to the 'fanciest affordable housing lobby in London', with green ribbed tiles and a patterned terrazzo floor. The walls of the office lobby are lined with timber slats, painted on their edges to look green from one direction and purple from another. Everything feels made and intended, and finished with a high degree of precision. It is a speculative building treated with the artistry of a gallery; a work of London urban vernacular translated into Swiss.\\nIn Arbroath, Scotland, Caruso St John have recently finished the latest phase of a project much more typical of their British commission – a patient, thoughtful renewal of a historic location dedicated to art. This is Hospitalfield, a large Victorian house grafted on to medieval fragments, the creation of the painter Patrick Allan Fraser and his wife, Elizabeth Fraser, after whose deaths it was bequeathed 'for the promotion of education in the arts'. Its style is piled-up baronial with details all of its own, much-turreted and many-gabled, a bold and eccentric stitched-together composite.\\nIt is now used for artists' residencies, with the public welcomed into its gardens, which have been revived and enriched by the landscape designer Nigel Dunnett, and (on tours) into the house. Here, the architects have been working with Hospitalfield's director, Lucy Byatt, for (so far) 10 years, both to open it up more and to rescue it from decades of neglect. They have restored a 19th-century fern house and designed a cafe next door in similar glassy style. They have renovated studios and designed a new one, and added some functional necessities. Planned for the future are a courtyard of rooms for visitors to stay, and a gallery to display collections and new work. It is a work of architectural gardening that 'brings each part of the site to life', as the architects put it, 'and allows things to regenerate'.\\nSome of Caruso St John's intervention is so discreet you'd hardly know it's there; some is about growing new architecture from the inner wonkiness of the old. The fern house and cafe, for example, look at first sight like regular greenhouses, except that the irregularities of the existing stone walls are allowed to push the new work into unexpected angles. The most striking addition is the new studio, a pale, tiled shed amplified by the castle's spirit of exaggeration. It is made only of essentials – eaves, rafters, gutters, cladding, two big windows; the adjustments necessary to fit on to old walls – but each has its own punchy character. This lightweight construction is as different as can be from its masonry surroundings, but it still seems to belong.\\nWhat connects a commercial block in London to a quietly delightful arts centre in the county of Angus is attention not only to detail but to what Caruso St John call 'the circumstances' of a project, to its what and where as well as its how. Both respond to their location and use, and as result are completely different from each other. These architects have no preconceived idea of what a building should look like, and they know when to hold back and let a place speak for itself. Which is not to say that they are shy and retiring – a work like St Pancras Campus is uningratiating, metaphorically spiky, none too anxious to please.\\nNow they relish the prospect of putting renovation at the centre of their work. 'We're not doing competitions for new buildings now,' says Caruso. 'I really don't see the point. Also I don't know what one would do, I don't know what's interesting.' If the St Pancras project really is their new-build swansong, it's not a bad way to finish off.\\nNew Art Gallery Walsall\\nWest Midlands, 2000\\nThis 30-metre off-kilter cube was Caruso St John's breakout success, reshaping Walsall's skyline and putting the young architects firmly on the map.\\nBrick House\\nWestbourne Grove, London, 2005\\nEarning them a spot on the Stirling Prize shortlist, the radically asymmetrical Brick House was designed to occupy a particularly awkward plot of land, squeezed between earlier residential buildings.\\nNewport Street Gallery\\nVauxhall, London, 2015\\nThe practice finally won the Stirling prize 10 years later with this loving conversion of numerous existing industrial buildings, originally as a London home for Damien Hirst's art collection.\\nRoyale Belge\\nBrussels, 2023\\nShowcasing their developing preference for renovating old buildings over creating new ones from scratch, this mammoth undertaking saw Caruso St John repurposing and updating a gigantic modernist office block on the outskirts of Brussels.

       "   'summary': 'JLGutierrez/E+ via Getty Images\\n\"We can draw lessons from the past, but we cannot live in it.\" -\\nLyndon B Johnson\\nCURRENT MACRO VIEW\\nUS economic activity remained solid in 1H24, although there has been some degree of slowing-most notably in the labor market (lower hiring rate, declining job vacancies, rising unemployment rate). The large downward revisions (-818k) to the jobs figures for the 12 months ending March 2024 should confirm that the labor market\\'s strength was overstated. While slower than expected, the revisions moved the monthly pace of job gains down to a still healthy monthly pace of 174k-a far cry from what we were told, but not forecasting a recession-like outcome.\\nWhile still elevated, inflation also moved in the right direction after the brief scare earlier this year. With consumers pushing back on price hikes and promotional activity increasing, further disinflation is likely. The point is that the economy is slowing, but it is not at risk of collapsing. So, the \"growth scare\" we experienced earlier this month has now transitioned back to a view that a soft landing still appears to be the most likely outcome.\\nWe haven\\'t discussed the sentiment surveys much lately, but the recent recovery rally has pushed bullish sentiment as measured by the AAII Sentiment Survey back above 50%. Historically, this survey has served as a contrarian indicator as the forward 12-month performance for the S&P 500 is flat and positive 60% of the time, following bullish readings above 50% dating back to 1987. As we approach the election, bullish sentiment, softening economic data, weak seasonal patterns, and potential policy rhetoric will likely lead to equity volatility in the coming months.\\nConsistent with softening economic data and a material decline in interest rates, there has been a defensive tilt to performance over the last month as defensives (Healthcare, Utilities, Staples, and Real Estate) have outperformed the overall market. We\\'ve seen new highs forged in the Healthcare sector, and it remains one of my top defensive selections due to troughing EPS growth. It also has the most attractive price-to-earnings growth ratio of all sectors.\\nThe FED\\nFor over a year, policymakers have pondered when to start easing their interest rate policy stance. It appears the stars have aligned for investors. With cooler inflation, a slowing economy, and a questionable labor market, the first-rate cut is on the table next week.\\nThe minutes of the recent FOMC meetings showed a \\'vast majority\\' of Fed officials thought it would be appropriate to cut rates at the next meeting in September. They indicated that their emphasis switched from inflation to the potential downside risks to employment. With policymakers onboard with a rate cut on 9/18, the path forward becomes more about the destination and how officials cut rates to get there. Markets are priced for an aggressive and front-loaded easing cycle with four cuts this year and nine total through 2025, with the notion that the first cut could be 50 basis points.\\nInvestors should be careful what they wish for. There have only been 14 rate-cutting cycles in history, so that is a small sample size. However, the data indicates that the equity market would rather see the Fed take the stairway down rather than jump into the elevator. Too much, too fast, can indicate an economy on the verge of collapsing. If we are now concentrating on the employment scene, it is probably time to start the easing cycle. I\\'m not in the camp that any of this will be a \"game changer\" for the market. As stated in earlier reports, no matter what the Fed does for the remainder of this year, it will not affect the economy until late 2025. In essence, this economy is on its own until then. Due to the wide disparity in platforms, the election results will determine the path of the economy and market as we enter 2025.\\nThe good news is that the Fed has plenty of room to ease if needed. The bad news is that if they have to cut rates fast, the economy is deteriorating rapidly. Given the latest commentary from Chair Powell, the Fed has already announced they will act in September, and in my view, it will be a 25 basis point cut. Since the indices are flirting near new all-time highs, I wouldn\\'t be shocked to see the rate cut become a \"sell the news\" event. From there, the Fed will likely return to the \"data dependent\" jargon instead of laying out any further cutting plans.\\nThe ELECTION\\nWhat a difference a few months can make. Just two months ago, former President Trump appeared to be sailing to victory as betting markets reflected a ~70% chance of a Trump win. However, with Biden stepping down and Vice President Harris securing the Democratic nomination, the election is now a toss-up-polling and betting markets signaling an extremely tight race. If there is anything the market does not like, it is uncertainty-particularly with valuations in the upper decile relative to history.\\nLooking back through history, open elections (two non-incumbent candidates running for the presidency) have led to increased volatility with the S&P 500 down ~3% on average and negative ~70% of the time from now until the election. As each candidate expands his/her policy platform moving forward (e.g., Harris\\' tax hike proposal and Biden\\'s agenda, Trump tariffs), volatility will likely remain elevated heading into election day.\\nElection Years (www.StockTradersAlmanac.com)\\nAfter the election, stocks tended to rally into the end of the year after shaking off the pre-election weakness. As always, we should not over-emphasize seasonality and prior cycles, but it\\'s something to remember. Given the vast differences in \"platforms,\" this year\\'s post-election market will depend on the election outcome, with \"taxes\" being the catalyst.\\nEARNINGS\\nI recently laid out a case for why Corporate America remained resilient since the pandemic, and with Q2 in the books, corporate fundamentals remained on solid ground. S&P 500 earnings were rising fastest (+11.3% YoY) since 4Q21. Earnings broadened beyond mega-cap tech, with S&P 500 exMAGMAN earnings rising meaningfully into positive territory in 2Q-the first time in two years. However, forward-looking estimates have been revised lower with a broad set of CEOs signaling a soft start to 3Q-particularly in travel spend and home improvement. The post-Covid spending spree is slowly ending.\\nEPS (www.factset.com)\\nWhile mega-cap tech earnings have been resilient, S&P 500 ex-MAGMAN 3Q24 EPS estimates have been cut ~7% over the last three months, bringing the growth rate from 8% at the start of earnings season to ~1-2% today. While earnings are expected to broaden moving forward, slowing economic activity may weigh on forward estimates-particularly 2025 EPS estimates that have been largely unscathed up to this point and are likely overly optimistic.\\nThe MARKETS\\nThe equity market has had smooth sailing to start the year-with the S&P 500 up ~18%, logging record high after record high, and only enduring one 9.7% peak-to-trough drawdown through August. This is calm relative to history, as the S&P 500 typically experiences 3 to 4%- 5% pullbacks on average per year and a max intra-year drawdown of ~13%. However, recent price action has been a reminder that volatility remains a part of the fabric of the market. The sharp rebound in recent weeks is a reminder that panic selling during periods of volatility is often a detriment to performance, and those investors with \"time\" on their side should stick to their long-term plan. With upcoming negative seasonality (September is historically the worst month of the year) and continued economic and political uncertainty, volatility will be part of the scene.\\nS&P (www.bespokepremium.com)\\nThe graphic indicates how we have transitioned from smooth sailing to a more difficult, volatile scene today.\\nSEASONALITY\\nAugust is over, and the next few months is likely to give investors some reason for caution. As noted, seasonality at the end of summer has historically been weak, but September has been even worse.\\nSeasonality (www.bespokepremium.com)\\nOver the past 100 years, September has by far been the worst month of the year, with an average decline of 1.24%, as it is also the only month in which the index has fallen the majority of the time. Similarly, over just the past 50 years, the Dow has averaged a decline of over 1% with positive returns barely more than a third of the time. Zeroing in more recently to the past 20 years, September is again weak, but other months like January, May, June, and August have seen worse average returns.\\nAs of Friday\\'s close, the major indices are slightly below the flatline except for the Russell 2000 small caps (-1.5%). This September will either be \"different,\" or investors are about to see more volatility and weakness ahead.\\nSENTIMENT\\nThe Investors Intelligence survey saw the percentage of respondents reporting as bullish rise to 53.2%, the highest level since the end of July. Right before the 8-9% pullback. Meanwhile, the NAAIM Exposure Index likewise pointed to investment managers raising equity exposure to the highest level of the month.\\nTypically, elevated readings in investor sentiment have been followed by weaker-than-normal returns. Forward returns for the S&P 500 have been considerably weaker across these instances, especially for three and twelve months out.\\nThe Trading Week\\nComing off the worst week for the S&P in 18 months and the worst start to a September in 20+ years, the \"lower prices\" attracted buyers as trading began on Monday. The S&P 500 gained 1.16% on the day, with strong breadth as every sector was higher. Consumer Discretionary and Industrials led the way higher, with each sector gaining over 1.5%. The Nasdaq gained an identical amount to the S&P 500,, and the Russell 2,000 underperformed with a 0.3% rally.\\nIt was a mixed session on Tuesday as investors seemed to be waiting for any catalyst to take the indices higher or lower. The S&P 500 built on Monday\\'s gains as it rose 0.45%. While the small-cap Russell 2,000 was marginally lower, the Nasdaq outperformed with a 0.84% gain. Real Estate, Consumer Discretionary, and Tech all gained over 1%. Energy and Financials were the worst performers. Energy\\'s weakness came as the price of WTI took another big leg lower, falling 3.52% to settle at $66.28, which, according to some, is a sign of a global recession brewing.\\nI\\'ve said that volatility would be with us going forward, but what occurred on Wednesday was one for the record books. The S&P 500 opened at 5496 and went downhill fast until buyers turned the scene around. The S&P closed at 5554, up 1% on the day-a 148-point turnaround off the lows. However, that was nothing compared to the DJIA and the NASDAQ Composite. The former saw a trading range of 900 points, while the latter experienced a 700-point swing. The indices closed up 0.37% and 2.3%, respectively.\\nOn Thursday, the S&P meandered around at the open before buying pressure mounted, pushing the index to another nice 0.75% gain. The Nasdaq outperformed, rising 1%, as did the small-cap Russell 2,000, which jumped 1.22%. Every sector was higher, with Communication Services the best performer, rising ~2%. Consumer Discretionary also posted a 1+% gain. In the last two days, money has also moved into gold, silver, and uranium.\\nThe BULLS put the cherry on top of the cake as the rally extended for the fifth day in a row on Friday. Every index and all eleven sectors saw gains. After one of the poorest weeks to start the month of September, the equity market turned it around, with the S&P recording a ~3.5% gain for the week. Despite the rally this week, it left the S&P (5625) right where it was before the selling began (5648). The same can be said for the NASDAQ Composite. There has been a lot of action in the last two weeks with limited results, leaving many investors frustrated by the volatility.\\nTHE ECONOMY\\nDifferent month - same results (perhaps worse) for the Small Business community.\\nThis week\\'s NFIB Small Business Optimism Index showed disappointing results. The index was expected to show a small decline, with the index forecasted to fall 0.1 points month over month to 93.6. Instead, the decline was much more dramatic, as it fell to 91.2, erasing all of the summer gains. One factor likely at play that we have noted in the past is political sensitivities.\\nThis is the 32nd consecutive month below the 50-year average of 98. The Uncertainty Index rose to 92, its highest level since October 2020. Inflation remains the top issue among small business owners, with 24% of owners reporting it as their top small business operating issue, down one point from July.\\nNFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg;\\n\"The mood on Main Street worsened in August. Historically high inflation remains the top issue for owners as sales expectations plummet and cost pressures increase. Uncertainty among small business owners continues to rise as expectations for future business conditions worsen.\"\\nINFLATION\\nThe August CPI report showed a rise of 0.2% overall and a core increase of 0.3%, the latter on the hotter side. These follow gains of 0.2% for both in July. The 12-month headline pace slowed to 2.5% y/y in August, down from 2.9% y/y previously and the slowest rate since February 2021.\\nInvestors shared opinions trying to decide if the Fed would cut rates by 25 or 50 bps next week. Despite WTI rebounding, the energy sector (XLE) lost 0.95%.\\nPPI came in higher than expected on both a headline (0.2% vs 0.1%) and core basis (0.3% vs 0.2%), but the year-over-year readings were both in line with forecasts, as July\\'s report was revised lower.\\nJobless claims, meanwhile, were largely in line with forecasts. Initial claims came in 4K higher than expected (230K vs 226K) while continuing claims were right in line.\\nThe Global Scene\\nThe European Central Bank statement this week;\\n\"The Governing Council today decided to lower the deposit facility rate - the rate through which it steers the monetary policy stance - by 25 basis points. Based on the Governing Council\\'s updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, it is now appropriate to take another step in moderating the degree of monetary policy restriction.\\nRecent inflation data have come in broadly as expected, and the latest ECB staff projections confirm the previous inflation outlook. Staff see headline inflation averaging 2.5% in 2024, 2.2% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026, as in the June projections. Inflation is expected to rise again in the latter part of this year, partly because previous sharp falls in energy prices will drop out of the annual rates.\\nInflation should then decline towards our target over the second half of next year. For core inflation, the projections for 2024 and 2025 have been revised up slightly, as services inflation has been higher than expected. At the same time, staff continue to expect a rapid decline in core inflation, from 2.9% this year to 2.3% in 2025 and 2.0% in 2026.\"\\nMACROECONOMY\\nThis section presents a series of issues that may not necessarily impact the market today but can pose problems for the MACRO scene.\\nThe SPENDING on the Green Agenda is a Bonfire that Uses Money as Fuel.\\nThe Anti-green movement has always been based on common sense. The proposed changes and mandates will continue to make a minuscule difference in the global climate. The technology isn\\'t yet available for it to make a difference, and the lack of results confirms that.\\nThe latest data also indicates that humans aren\\'t about to change Mother Nature. Last year, the Canadian wildfires released four times more carbon into the atmosphere than global aviation. NASA reported that the five-month-long fires added more carbon to the atmosphere than Germany, Russia, or Japan in 2022. This data only represents what occurred in Canada, the US, and other areas prone to wildfires, and it\\'s easy to see Mother Nature is in control.\\nWhile utilizing technology to limit carbon emissions has been worthwhile in the private sector, government climate mandates are nothing more than extremes that will cost trillions with no return on investment-trillions that can no longer be justified. They must either be severely scaled back or remain a ball and chain around the economy\\'s ankle.\\nSEMICONDUCTORS will lead the Next Revolution\\nThe U.S. makes only 12% of the world\\'s chips, a steep decline from 37% in the 1990s. In the more critical and profitable advanced designs, foundries in Asia produce over 90% of these chips. Every American should be fully aligned to strengthen American manufacturing and supply chains, enabling U.S. companies to compete more effectively and reverse these trends.\\nSome consider the Administration\\'s bipartisan CHIPS Act a worthwhile endeavor, but it\\'s another example of the government picking winners and losers. History has already told us that this never works out well. It may also produce unintended consequences that not many are talking about. The CHIPS Act funding is going to the nation\\'s largest chip companies, the same companies that lost their competitive edge to TSMC and Samsung in the first place.\\nIt\\'s a pipe dream to believe these large companies will now catch up to their Asian counterparts. Ironically, an administration that is all about breaking up large corporations and providing competition avoided assistance to help smaller U.S. companies-companies that can provide the innovation behind key technologies of tomorrow and manufacture domestically. Recent developments confirm that view.\\nIntel received 20 billion in taxpayer funds, and the administration touted that it would be a great investment in jobs. As it turns out, there will be no such job creation. Despite the windfall, Intel announced it will cut 15% of its workforce or ~15,000 jobs.\\nBesides that, creating US jobs wasn\\'t Intel\\'s high priority the administration thought it would be. Intel already had plans to \"offshore\" production in Germany, but those plans are being scrapped because of the company\\'s dire financial position. If you give Congress money through additional taxes, they will find a way to spend it. The problem is compounded when that money becomes part of the \"Burning Bonfire.\"\\nThe Treasury Department reported Thursday that the U.S. government has spent more than $1 trillion this year on interest payments on its $35.3 trillion national debt, the first time in history. That should signal that there can be no tolerance for further spending that doesn\\'t produce results, but that message has been ignored.\\nIt should be very obvious what needs to be cut and what needs to be totally eliminated. Keep receiving existing Social Security benefits or see a windmill farm built in Oklahoma?\\nA choice that may have to be made; the existing path is unsustainable.\\nThe Daily chart of the S&P 500 (SPY)\\nAfter a breakdown appeared imminent, five straight days of gains (with plenty of volatility thrown in) for the S&P 500 have the index ready to challenge the July Highs.\\nS&P 500 (www.freestockcharts.com)\\nThe S&P is once again at the crossroads. The index now faces a choice: It can run to new highs on STRONG price action like we saw this week or drop back into the trading range on WEAK price action like we witnessed in the prior week.

       "   'excerpt': \"Always prone to natural disasters, the country's plight has worsened, and not only because of the climate crisis\",\n",
       "   'summary': \"On 10 May 2024, Haroon Nafas was in his family's guesthouse in Baghlan, north Afghanistan, spending time with friends who had come to stay. It had been raining lightly all through the afternoon, but at about 3pm the group heard a loud crashing noise.\\n'We immediately went outside to see what was causing the sound,' says Nafas. 'Initially, we were confused, thinking it might have been a plane. But then we realised, no, it's a flood.'\\nNafas rushed home to his own house, which fortunately was located up on a hillside, and started gathering his family. Meanwhile, several town members sought shelter atop the local mosque, including Nafas's brothers, who used a mulberry tree to climb on to the roof and reach safety.\\nOthers were not so lucky. 'The flood was very severe, maybe up to 30 metres high,' says Nafas. 'People were even dragged in from the roofs of certain buildings. The damage from the waters spread several kilometres. Some households lost up to 11 family members.'\\nOver two days, at least 315 people were killed in Baghlan and more than 2,000 homes destroyed. About 1,600 people were injured, and hundreds more were missing. Flash floods also wreaked havoc in other provinces across Afghanistan, with at least 50 people killed in Ghor.\\nAfghanistan has always been prone to natural disasters. Among low-income nations, it ranked second in the number of deaths caused by them between 1980 and 2015, according to one report. However, the frequency and extremity of disasters such as flash flooding is on the rise, and climate breakdown is not solely responsible for these changes. The country's history of armed conflict has exacerbated the situation severely.\\nDr Najibullah Sadid, an environmental researcher and water resources expert based in Germany, says it is crucial that warring parties are held more accountable as toxic artillery often gets left behind and damages the environment. Explosives can damage ecosystems, disrupt biodiversity and weaken soil structure, and can damage groundwater resources.\\nAccording to a report by the Progressive magazine, the US dropped more than 85,000 bombs on Afghanistan between 2001 and 2021. In spots where massive ordnance air blast bombs, nicknamed 'the mother of all bombs', were dropped, such as Nangarhar province, scientists have found that plant yields halved due to the spread of toxins. Such toxins can also be carried to other regions by the wind or in water.\\nMine contamination is another problem. As of 2021, only one of Afghanistan's 34 provinces had ever (temporarily) been declared mine-free. The remaining 33 provinces still have explosive ordnance scattered across them. Despite this, funding for the country's mine action sector has been declining, from $113m (£86m) in 2011 to $32m in 2020. The Taliban takeover in August 2021 has threatened these streams further, as many donors remain reluctant to engage with the new government, despite improved operating conditions and access to previously unreachable locations. According to the United Nations Mine Action Service about 45,000 Afghan civilians have been killed or wounded by landmines since 1989.\\nSadid says the mines have a direct connection to the recent flash floods: 'Landmines [and] de-mining activity disrupt soil structure. Disrupt this, and you are basically exposing the soil to erosion. The debris flow in Baghlan, for example, can be linked to war because the floods originated from a valley which is completely dry.'\\nConflict-caused deforestation also worsens flash floods. In 1970, Afghanistan had 2.8m hectares (6.9m acres) of forest, covering 4.5% of the country. By 2016, this had shrunk to about 1.5%. In Nuristan, a province in eastern Afghanistan, forest cover had reduced by 53% in that time.\\n'Vegetation retains a lot of rainwater,' says Sadid. 'When there is no forest, the land becomes exposed to landslides, and the runoff increases. That's why we now see very extreme flash floods occurring in some parts of Afghanistan.'\\nFor Sayed Abdul Baset, a disaster risk reduction expert and Herat resident, the issue hits close to home. The former adviser to the Afghan government says there is still an opportunity to unite and mobilise despite the problems caused by climate breakdown.\\n'These natural disasters are related to the activities of the land,' he says. 'They show how unsafe our homes are, how weak our coping capacity and early warning systems are. We don't have water pipes. The topography of the soil is not good. There is no flood zoning. People live in floodplains. It is a very painful picture. It is no less than a war.'\\nSohila Akbari, who is based in Herat, has been leading humanitarian efforts as part of a 12-woman team for more than a decade.\\nWith financial contributions collected from the Afghan diaspora and donors abroad, her grassroots organisation Committee Akbari regularly distributes emergency aid such as food, clothes and tents to the city's poorest and disaster-struck.\\n'I first started interacting with those struggling through my work as a teacher,' says Akbari. 'Slowly, I started to develop an interest in finding other ways to help. I've since connected with Afghans all over to try to take the work further.'\\nAkbari was herself a victim of the devastating series of earthquakes that hit Herat in October 2023, killing more than 2,000 people. 'It was a very horrible day. We hadn't experienced an earthquake in years. It took us all by surprise.'\\nShe recalls hearing a horrible noise that resembled explosions. 'You couldn't even stand. The ground would go out from under you. Our house was on the third floor so it was especially bad. I remember telling the children to run, just run. Don't worry about me. They ran. I was in the stairwell when the ceiling caved. I thought I was finished.'\\nThey spent the next few days seeking shelter in a local school. After two days, Akbari resumed her distribution efforts to those who had been most severely affected.\\n'We are in the city. What else can we do if we don't help? We will do our best. What little we can do, we will do it,' she says.\\nIt is through locals such as Akbari, who are already familiar with the people affected, that aid can have the most successful outcome, says the longtime climate journalist Laurie Goering.\\n'This is the giant question in climate finance right now. How do you actually move such big amounts of money from governments and organisations to those women in Afghanistan? Taking advantage of local systems and actors, and finding intermediary groups to get more of that money to where it's needed is really important,' Goering says.\\nSign up to Down to Earth\\nThe planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential\\nafter newsletter promotion\\nAs for how much compensation warring states owe for the destruction caused in Afghanistan, Goering refers to the United Nations Development Programme's loss and damage fund as a good place to start. This is a new fund aimed at helping impoverished nations cope with the damage caused by climate-induced natural disasters. Support will be offered in the form of grants.\\n'The fund is designed to help communities and countries recover from things they couldn't have adapted to,' says Goering. 'So that money would be really useful in places like Afghanistan.'\\nSince their rise to power in August 2021, the Taliban have remained excluded from the global stage. For Goering, this poses an extra challenge: 'It's hard to get funds if you're excluded from international systems. There's a lot of thinking at the moment about how to move money to very vulnerable places without going through the government.'\\nDespite Afghanistan being one of the countries most vulnerable to global heating, due to its arid climate, mountainous topography and reliance on agriculture, it was once again excluded from the Cop28 climate talks last year, something Goering says is problematic.\\n'Afghanistan doesn't have high emissions,' she says. 'This is something that's happening globally, that everybody must work on together. Otherwise, we won't solve the problem.'\\nIt is a sentiment shared by Rahmani, who believes support from international institutions and existing data could go a long way: 'We need to create a roadmap for each region of Afghanistan. Also, 60% of Afghans are young. They can be taught. With a very small budget, they can be provided with employment, education and training in the climate field.'\\nHowever, to truly muster the potential of younger generations, Rahmani admits better climate awareness is a crucial first step: 'People think that this is God's will, that because of our sins, these disasters happen to us and that we can't do anything about it. Such beliefs and social behaviours have a lot of impact.'\\nRahmani also hopes to see more remediation from warring parties, as well as high-emitting nations.\\n'These countries have a responsibility,' he says. 'This is happening because of them. Places like the United States, England, Brazil and China – they keep their industry alive with fossil fuels and adapt themselves and raise their resilience. But for Afghanistan, which is currently very limited in terms of global relations, those conditions are completely closed.'\\nIn March, the UN security council voted to extend its mission in Afghanistan for another year, but this is focused mostly on the humanitarian crisis rather than climate impacts.\\nThere is also an ongoing parliamentary inquiry in the Netherlands on the impact of the Dutch and Nato's 20-year intervention in Afghanistan. Similar initiatives by other countries embedded in the Nato campaign could accelerate reparations and aid.\\nFor Rahmani, prioritising smart policies and expanding irrigation projects, such as those implemented in recent years across Nangarhar province, is the way to go.\\n'We had a very large climate project a while ago, backed by millions of dollars. But unfortunately, all the work is suspended. We need funds. These are very serious issues. It is very necessary for the people of the world to be united so that we can solve these problems.'\\nSince the Taliban takeover in 2021, large-scale conflict has reduced significantly. According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, no new conflict displacement was recorded in 2023. However, by the end of that year, there were still 1.5 million people internally displaced as a result of natural disasters.\\nFor Baghlan resident Nafas, the most pressing need for those affected is clean water. He hopes the humanitarian response offers a solution before the situation on the ground worsens.\\n'The tap systems have all been damaged,' he says. 'All the canals are covered with mud. There is no drinking water, no water for ablution, for people's livestock, for agriculture. Incomes have also been suspended. People are living in makeshift tents. It's chaos. It is hot now but soon the cold season will come.'\\nInterviewees' names have been changed to protect their identities.\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': \"Rivalries in Italy take the country's flair for nicknames to tender and tasty places\",\n",
       "   'summary': \"What's in a nickname?\\nThat is a question The Athletic has been answering this week as we trace the origins of football clubs' monikers in England, Germany, France, Spain and the rest of the world.\\nThis time, we're looking at the nicknames — flattering and otherwise — in Italian football.\\nMore on the intriguing world of nicknames in football…\\nLet's begin with a deep cut. A lombata if you're familiar with Italian butchery. Rivalries in Italy take the country's flair for nicknames to tender and tasty places. It's not enough to know the colour scheme of a jersey (Biancocelesti, Rossoneri, Giallorossi), a local landmark (a fountain, a volcano, sometimes both) or a spirit animal (Ascoli's is the woodpecker) to appreciate their flair for nicknames.\\nYou need to really get under the skin.\\nSampdoria, for instance, have arguably the most beautiful jersey not just in Italy, but the world. There's no sash, no stripes, no checks. The blue base layer with the white, red and black hoop (Blucerchiato) is unique in football.\\nTo neighbours Genoa, however, their 'cousins' do not belong in this sport. They deridingly call them ciclisti. That's right. Cyclists because the jersey resembles the kind of garb Fausto Coppi used to wear as he wound his way up the Stelvio Pass. (In retaliation, Samp fans look at the mythological griffin on Genoa's old crest with the same disdain Roma supporters show when faced with Lazio's imperial eagle. They both mock these proud-winged creatures as a piccione; a shabby pigeon.)\\nStaying with Roma, they are nicknamed La Magica (isn't it magical at the Olimpico when they're playing?) or Lupi, the wolf being as prevalent in Italian football as foxes are in London gardens. The she-wolf and her place in the Eternal City's origin story is the pack leader of lupi in Italy — better than those of Avellino, Cosenza and the one pawing underneath an oak tree on Lecce's badge.\\nLecce, incidentally, are better known as the Salentini for the stretch of the Otranto coastline on Italy's heel. Puglia is home to Foggia as well, whose nickname is the Satanelli or Little Satans, a variation of AC Milan's nickname the Diavolo for whom the club's founder Herbert Kilpin is to thank. A Nottingham lad, Kilpin promised Milan would be a team of devils, 'red like fire and black like the fear we'll invoke in our opponents'.\\nSan Siro room-mates Inter are characterised by the Biscione, a basilisk that somehow slithered its way off the coat of arms of some Milanese nobles. When Inter signed Darko Pancev, a European Cup-winning forward from Red Star Belgrade in 1992, it seemed like a marriage made in heaven as he was called the Cobra, but his performances at the Giuseppe Meazza were so venom-less he quickly became referred to as Ramarro; the grass snake.\\nInter, for what it's worth, also go by Beneamata (well-loved or fondly thought of) although it would be wrong to suggest they are thought of that way in Turin where their bitterest enemies reside. Inter fans aren't the only ones to adapt Juventus to Rubentus and create a neologism out of the verb rubare, which means to steal.\\nTorino fans claim their team is more rooted in Turin — much like Manchester City fans do with Manchester — and this Maroon Eleven identify with the city's icon, a prancing bull, as their spirit animal. In addition to Rubentus, fans of Il Toro will lean into calling Juventus hunchbacks or Gobbi, as will Fiorentina, a reference to Juventus kits from the 1950s that billowed at the back and made their players look like Quasimodos who, in Italian folklore, are considered absurdly lucky.\\nMore charitable and less contested names for Juventus will follow. It's not her fault if the Girlfriend of Italy, as the club is also known, attracts as much envy as she does love.\\nDon't worry, though, she can handle herself, as can Atalanta, a heroine and huntress from Greek mythology. Quite how the Dea (Goddess) has let Bournemouth copy her look without releasing an arrow in anger is a mystery.\\nFor a region that gave Italy its unifying language, Tuscany isn't particularly verbose, at least when it comes to nicknames for its clubs. Fiorentina are simply known as the Viola (purple), Empoli the Azzurri (blues), Pisa the Nerazzurri (black and blues; why not the Towers?!). Livorno occasionally go by the Triglie, literally the Mullets, although this is a reference to one of the city's most famous dishes, which features red mullet (and shares in the colour of their jerseys) rather than the hairstyle.\\nCrossing the Apennines into Emilia-Romagna, the relatively few enthusiasts for Etruscan civilisation in commentary booths talk about Bologna as the Felsinei, an ancient sect probably responsible for some of the artefacts dug up by the troubled British archaeologist-turned-looter in Alice Rohrwacher's recent arthouse film La chimera.\\nWhen Parma were workshopping a jersey in 1914, the founders settled on the city's links with the Crusades rather than classical music and Giuseppe Verdi. And so the cross they bear is one of the go-to monikers people reach for — Crociati — when they aren't calling them the Gialloblu (the yellow and blues).\\nAnother team in those colours, Hellas Verona, is spoken about as the Butei although you won't find any peach emojis on their social media. Butei is Veneto-dialect for 'the lads' and it isn't Hellas' only nickname. Their crest is like that of Verona's medieval rulers, the Scalas, showing a ladder (literally a Scala, hence their nickname Gli Scaligeri) and a couple of fierce-looking mastiffs (Mastini, another of their nicknames).\\nElsewhere, Cagliari have been anointed the team of Sardinia, no matter the protests from Olbia or Torres, which means they are either known by the local dialect name of their city Casteddu or simply as the Sardi or Sardinians. Up by the Slovenian border, Udinese are also proud representatives of their region, Friuli, so you'll hear Friulani more than Zebrette, which indicates the Zebra-like stripes they have in common with Juventus who we return to, along with some of the other interestingly nicknamed clubs, below. Juventus\\nNickname: La Vecchia Signora (The Old Lady)\\nYou can see her behind the goal at the Allianz Stadium, twirling in the Scirea end. Lady Juventus. The Contessa. The Nonna. Depicted in a flag held up by one of the banner-men among the ultras, she means different things to different people.\\nHow she came to be identified with a club whose name is Latin for 'youth' is one of life's paradoxes. But when the Agnelli family bought the team a century ago, it felt like Italy's girlfriend, as Juventus were also known for their popularity, became a lady. Whether she has aged gracefully over the years is in the eye of the beholder.\\nThe club's tendency, in the past, to have a veteran core and faithful servants who played into their forties meant a nickname needed to counterbalance the dissonance with the actual name. However, the recent contributions from their Next Gen reserves in the first team have ensured Juventus are truer to their original moniker than ever before. Venezia\\nNickname: The Lagunari (Lagooners)\\nVenezia could perhaps have been called l'Arsenale. The city was famous, at least until the Corsican who gave his name to short-man syndrome pillaged it, for the armoury that weaponised ships for the various doges to annex large swathes of the Dalmatian coast and islands of the Ionian and Aegean seas. But Venezia was the name some gymnasts settled on when they decided to swap parallel bars for goalposts and form a football club in 1907.\\nStill, an unintentional hat-tip to Arsenal lives on in Venezia's sobriquet. As with other football clubs up and down Italy, yet weirdly not Como — who should be known as the Lakers — a landmark is used in association. In this case, it's the Venetian lagoon on which Vaporettis speed to the islands of Murano and Burano. Instead of the Gooners, Venezia are the Lagunari instead — the 'Lagooners'. Napoli\\nNickname: O Ciuccio (The Donkey)\\nYou will almost always hear Napoli referred to as the Partenopei. This goes back to the city's origin story as an Ancient Greek settlement by the name Partenope, which is the title of the Neapolitan film director Paolo Sorrentino's upcoming film. But in the rust bowl that is the Maradona, it is not uncommon to see the club's spirit animal: a braying, flea-bitten donkey known, in local dialect, as O Ciuccio.\\nBack in the day, Napoli's first, rather ornate crest featured a horse prancing on a football. Think of a less iconic version of the Ferrari one. Terrible in their inaugural season as a club — Inter thrashed Napoli 9-2 then Juventus gave them an 8-0 hiding — it has passed into folklore that, one day, a group of fans were standing in Bar Pippone lamenting Napoli's latest defeat when a local rag-and-bone man walked past with a donkey pulling a cart. 'Prancing horse,' they scoffed. 'Yeah right! More like Fechella's donkey with his sores and his festering tail.'\\nA reporter at the Corriere del Mezzogiorno picked up on fans calling the team a donkey while covering games and committed the nickname to print. All of a sudden Fechella's mule became beloved so much so that he was paraded around the pitch after Napoli came back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 against Juventus in 1930. The team of Ferrari's future owners Fiat, Juventus, with all their horsepower, had miraculously been caught by a donkey.\\nO Ciuccio has inspired 'hit' songs like this from when Napoli regained their top-flight status and began to qualify for Europe again under current owner Aurelio De Laurentiis.\\nO Ciuccio is not to be confused with the Flying Donkeys of Chievo Verona. In other ass-related sobriquets, this one came about when Chievo, a team from a suburb of Verona, incredibly began climbing up the Italian football pyramid. Fans of Hellas, the 1985 Scudetto winners, liked to say donkeys would fly before they played a derby in Serie A. But in 2001, it happened and although Chievo lost the first one, they won the next Derby della Scala and finished an incredible fifth in their debut season in the top flight. Benevento\\nNickname: The Sorcerers\\nShakespeare set 10 of his plays in Italy. He could perhaps have staged Macbeth in Benevento. 'Double, double, toil and trouble' resembles this supposed spell from the Campanian town: 'Nguento, 'nguento, manname a lu nocio 'e Beneviento, sott'a ll'acqua e sotto o viento, sotto a ogne maletiempo.' Stories about a coven of witches gathering underneath a walnut tree in Benevento have been passed down since the 13th century. They'd steal horses and fly around, however, these necromancers suffered a blow in the 1940s when a bridge they supposedly used to get airborne was destroyed during World War II.\\nStill, it didn't stop them from being a complete nuisance. Locals would pour a goal line of salt along the threshold of their house or lay a broom across it to stop the janaras, as they were known, from entering. By the time they'd counted every grain or fibre, it would be sunrise and the witches were at risk of melting.\\nThis seemed to explain why Benevento or, to give them their nickname the Sorcerers, lost their first 14 games in Serie A in 2017. The bright lights of Serie A were too much. Crotone\\nNickname: The Pythagoreans\\nFootball is about angles and whether or not you can manipulate geometry to your advantage. It attracts philosophers and, more recently, nerds who come up with equations that explain the inexplicable, such as the value of various spaces in a rectangle. Unfortunately, none of this is relevant when telling the story of why Crotone are known as the Pitagorici or Pythagoreans.\\nAs was the case with Naples and many other parts of the south of Italy and Sicily, Crotone was a Greek colony by the name of Kroton, which sounds like a planet on which superheroes are born. In fact, there is a crater on Mars named after this Calabrian town.\\nBefore dying because he refused to run through a field of fava beans — if you're wondering, they filled him with more mortal dread than the men Polycrates had sent in pursuit of him — the philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras opened a school in Kroton.\\nIt did not have the influence on Italian football that Coverciano did on the leafy outskirts of Florence (that's where coaches do their badges in Italy) but Davide Nicola did manage the equivalent of solving one of those unsolvable math problems when 34 points somehow equalled an improbable top-flight survival in 2017.\\n(Top image: Designed by Eamonn Dalton)\",\n",

Inflation data in Canada and the UK should play second fiddle to Wednesday's FOMC decision.

       "   'summary': \"Jim Farley had just returned from China. What the Ford Motor chief executive found during the May visit made him anxious: The local automakers were pulling away in the electric-vehicle race.\\nIn an early-morning call with fellow board member John Thornton, an exasperated Farley unloaded.\\nThe Chinese carmakers are moving at light speed, he told Thornton, a former Goldman Sachs executive who spent years as a senior banker in China. They are using artificial intelligence and other tech in cars that is unlike anything available in the U.S. These Chinese EV makers are using a low-cost supply base to undercut the competition on price, offering slick digital features and aggressively expanding to overseas markets.\\n'John, this is an existential threat,' Farley said.\\nFor years, Tesla was the main source of consternation for auto CEOs trying to tackle a transition to electric vehicles. Now, it is the rapid rise of nimble automakers in China that have rattled executives from Detroit to Germany and Japan. Even Tesla's Elon Musk recently called the Chinese the 'most competitive' carmakers in the world.\\nIn the span of a few years, Chinese EV maker BYD, backed by Warren Buffett, and other domestic brands have clawed away gobs of market share in China from once-dominant foreign rivals, through a combination of lower prices, high-tech interiors and rapid vehicle updates. Today, they are quickly expanding in Europe, the Middle East and other Asian markets.\\nIn the U.S., carmakers see EVs as their future, but for now, EV sales growth has slowed, as high prices and charging hassles turn off some shoppers.\\nShortly after the trip, Farley arranged to have Chinese EVs shipped to Michigan for executives and directors to check out and sit in. The models were displayed in a Ford conference center near its headquarters. During board-meeting coffee breaks, directors took turns fiddling with cars.\\nOne was the first EV from smartphone giant Xiaomi, which has drawn comparisons to a Porsche and sells for $30,000 to $40,000, below Ford's similarly sized Mustang Mach-E SUV. The Xiaomi has a fragrance diffuser and an infotainment system that can connect to devices inside the home when the car approaches—turning on the home lights or air conditioner, for example.\\nThere was also a $77,000 futuristic-looking electric minivan from Li Auto. The plush seats in the rear rows have heated arm and leg rests, and massive multimedia screens controlled by hand gestures. Ford brass compared the setup to business-class air travel or a home theater.\\n'Executing to a Chinese standard is going to be the most important priority,' Farley said.\\nChinese brands have so far been kept out of the U.S. by steep tariffs, geopolitical tensions and regulatory hurdles. But some have established a toehold in Mexico, where China-built vehicles—both EVs and combustion-engine vehicles—now account for about 20% of sales.\\nGovernments around the world are worried about China's EV expansion, citing everything from potential job losses to data-security concerns. In the European Union, where Chinese imports make up about one-fifth of electric sales, regulators recently disclosed plans for tariffs up to nearly 50%. The Biden administration went further with a roughly 100% tariff.\\nFarley, a 62-year-old, blunt-talking car fanatic who spent the early part of his career in marketing at Toyota Motor, sees Chinese EVs as an immediate threat in Europe and other overseas markets, and a long-term risk in Ford's profit engine of North America, regardless of protectionist measures.\\nFarley often reminds his executive team of how Toyota and other Japanese car companies grabbed market share from the U.S. automakers in the 1980s and 1990s, followed in recent decades by Korea's Hyundai and Kia, which have found success with EVs.\\n'I've seen this movie before,' said Farley, who has been Ford's CEO for four years.\\nA few humbling trips to China in the past 18 months prompted Farley to alter his EV strategy.\\nOn a visit to China last year, he watched engineers dissect an electric car from Chinese juggernaut BYD to reveal elegant, low-cost engineering. A spin around a test track in another China-branded EV left him blown away by the car's ride quality and high-tech features.\\nThose experiences persuaded Farley to narrow Ford's focus in China to commercial vehicles, rather than trying to compete with local manufacturers in its consumer market. Now, he is racing to fend off the threat of Chinese EVs elsewhere—in part by borrowing from them.\\nThe CEO has a team exploring ways to contract with some of the same low-cost parts suppliers that have given Chinese EV makers such a big edge. He has pivoted Ford's strategy toward smaller EVs, because for now the huge batteries needed for big pickups and SUVs are too expensive. That strategic shift resulted in the recent, high-profile cancellation of a future Ford Explorer-size electric SUV.\\nFord is developing a low-cost mechanical layout to serve as the foundation for several future EVs. Among the first will be a midsize pickup truck due to arrive in 2027.\\nFarley sees the China threat as a test of his efforts to change Ford's culture and make his people move faster.\\n'Either he can make us uncomfortable, or we can wait, and the Chinese can make us uncomfortable,' said Doug Field, a former Tesla and Apple executive hired in 2021 to lead Ford's technical transformation.\\nFor decades, Ford and other global carmakers did not view Chinese automakers as much of a threat.\\nChina opened its auto market to foreign companies in the 1980s under the condition that they enter joint ventures with fledgling state-owned carmakers. The local manufacturers mostly played little-sibling roles to their foreign JV partners, helping them to navigate red tape and providing some capital to build factories.\\nMeanwhile, Beijing was methodically investing in a plan to leapfrog global carmakers through a move to electric cars. The government offered generous subsidies for car companies to build EVs, and for consumers to buy them. Huge investment into car chargers also nurtured the EV market.\\nBy early this decade, those once-shaky Chinese companies—joined by a few hundred startups—had begun churning out stylish, affordable EVs. BYD in particular pulled away from the pack, selling more than three million electric and plug-in-hybrid cars last year, nearly seven times higher than in 2019.\\nBYD's cheapest EV, the Seagull, starts around $10,000 and features a fashionable cabin; a rotating, iPad-like touch screen; and more than 300 miles of driving range, comparable to EVs from legacy automakers that are priced three times higher. It is currently for sale in China and Latin America and BYD plans to start selling it in Europe next year for around $20,000.\\nIn early 2023, Farley made his first trip to China since it reopened after years of pandemic restrictions. He sat in the driver seat of an electric SUV from Ford's longtime joint-venture partner, Changan Automobile, which for years had been a middling player in China, its market share hovering around 5%.\\nFarley, who races vintage cars and has an encyclopedic knowledge of car models, thrashed the EV around Changan's sprawling test track in central China, as Ford Chief Financial Officer John Lawler rode shotgun. Afterward the executives sat silently, stunned at the progress Changan had made. The ride was smooth and quiet and the cabin upscale, with easy-to-use technology.\\n'Jim, this is nothing like before,' Lawler told Farley after the drive. 'These guys are ahead of us.'\\nFarley was born in Buenos Aires. His father was a banker, and the family relocated many times. He also had some Detroit roots: His grandfather joined Ford in 1913 as a factory worker.\\nA big Steve Jobs fan, Farley says his favorite photo of the Apple founder shows him crouched and peering into an office to watch a worker on a Macintosh computer in the 1980s.\\nAs a young marketer at Toyota, Farley spent a year on the road doing research for a new Camry sedan, chatting up car owners in store parking lots.\\n'He's just constantly scanning the market,' said Ted Cannis, the head of Ford's commercial-vehicle business. Cannis said last year he was caught off guard when Farley asked him about a new, China-built commercial van that had barely registered on the U.K. sales charts.\\n'I'm completely distrusting of research,' Farley said in a recent interview. 'I like watching what people do. See where they spend their money.'\\nA first cousin of the late comedian Chris Farley, he has embraced the limelight during his four years as CEO. He hosts a podcast that has featured Tom Brady and Sydney Sweeney, and has taken Jimmy Fallon out on the racetrack. He is prolific on social media, sometimes bantering with Elon Musk.\\nHe can be brusque and intense in meetings. Farley has been known to interrupt people midsentence and tell them to 'stop admiring the problem' and come up with a solution, executives who have worked with him say.\\nJon Huntsman, a longtime Ford director, said Farley is not a polished glad-hander or a 'prototypical CEO.' 'He's distrustful until you earn his trust,' Huntsman said. 'He's brutally honest, to the point of being offensive.'\\nDuring a Morgan Stanley investor conference last year, Farley was asked what superpower he would choose.\\n'Kindness,' Farley said. 'I'd like to be more kind.'\\nFord's EV transition has been made more challenging by quality problems and costly recalls. Farley said things have improved recently after Ford tied worker bonuses to vehicle-quality metrics.\\nFollowing early buzz for the F-150 Lightning pickup, which lifted the stock price, fading consumer interest in EVs led to pricing pressure and heavy red ink. Ford is on pace to lose about $5 billion on EVs this year, equal to as much as half of its projected operating profit.\\nFarley says erasing those losses is his top priority. 'The sense of urgency is so high because the $5 billion loss is so visible,' Farley said.\\nThat test-track run in early 2023 convinced Farley and Lawler to give up on trying to reclaim Ford's status as a major player in China. Ford is using China primarily to export vehicles to other markets. Farley has vowed to apply lessons from China elsewhere before the Chinese pull ahead again.\\nFarley said he is confident that the team working on the new EV tech—led by another former Tesla engineer—can erase the cost gap with the Chinese EV makers. If that effort is successful, Farley said he believes Ford's expertise in trucks, off-road vehicles and the commercial market will give it an edge.\\nFor a company that sells huge pickups and SUVs for $70,000, offering an EV for a fraction of that price requires some tough calls to keep costs in check.\\nOne day this past summer, Farley walked through Ford's design studio near the company's headquarters to check the status of several future EVs. One prototype seemed like it would be at home in China's family-centric car market. It featured a configurable rear seating area with seats that can swivel to create a meeting space.\\nFarley and Field huddled around a laptop, looking at a spreadsheet of line items for the future midsize electric pickup. The goal: figure out how to extract $800 in cost.\\nThe team had overachieved on the driving range by 16 miles, Field explained, which meant they could wring out about $500 by shrinking the battery. Finding the rest of the savings would be a slog. Would it really need a heated steering wheel? Maybe the front trunk was expendable, one of the execs suggested.\\nBefore long, Farley worried aloud that they might be cutting too many corners, and that 'the product could end up being really sh—y.' He suggested to Field an informal process: How about they slap sticky notes all over the prototype to hash out what should go?\\n'Then let's get 20 people who we all trust in a room,' Farley said. 'And we argue about it.'\\nBen Glickman contributed to this article.\\nWrite to Mike Colias at mike.colias@wsj.com\",\n",

       "(\"In the details, there is a 24% loan loss provision and a 5% increase in Commerzbank's OpEx guidance. Thirdly, there is a pending litigation concern about the mBank CHF mortgage. On the loan volume, there was a 9% decline in consumer lending, which was offset by corporate clients, which delivered a plus 3% on a quarterly basis and a plus 5% on a yearly comparison. The German mortgage business was stable, but there is a continued shift from sight deposits to call money. This might decrease the NII evolution. That said, the company reiterated the Fiscal Year 2024 NII guidance of around €8.1 billion (Fig 3). While volume growth and loan loss provision are temporary concerns, we believe that OpEx outlook and litigation might trigger future profitability and distributions. The company needs to show effective cost control, considering cost and wage inflation. This might result in a pre-tax consensus downgrade. On the downside, the bank booked €240 million for the CHF litigation and confirmed the total litigation provisions below €1.1 billion. The bank CET 1 ratio is vital. Despite the NII decline due to a normalized interest rate environment and a P&L drag from mBank CHF mortgage litigation, we are below the bank's net income projection. That said, before the UniCredit acquisition, the bank was trading at a P/E of 5.7x (2025) with a P/TNAV of 0.5x. This is well below EU bank peers with a P/E of 7x and a P/TNAV between 0.8/1x.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"New Delhi: China's PC shipments (including desktops, notebooks and workstations) fell by 6 per cent (year-on-year) to 9.1 million in the April-June quarter as weak demand continued. The country's PC shipments declined by 6 per cent in Q2, with the consumer and commercial sectors falling by 3 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively, as per a Canalys report.\\nAnalyst Emma Xu said that the competitive dynamics of China's PC market are rapidly increasing in complexity. 'Local AI regulations have constrained the full deployment of Microsoft's Copilot in Mainland China. This is pushing vendors toward localised strategies to develop AI PCs, either by integrating in-house AI assistants or by building their own AI application ecosystems through collaboration with developers,' Xu explained.\\nThe forecast anticipates 13 per cent penetration of AI-capable PCs in Greater China in 2024. According to the report, vendors will need to make consistent portfolio investments to execute on their AI PC roadmaps and adapt their go-to-market strategies to be flexible and localised to the unique market requirements.\\nIn contrast, tablet sales increased by 20 per cent to reach 7.8 million units in the April-June quarter, driven by increasing adoption and online promotions. The tablet market is highly competitive, as more smartphone vendors expand their portfolios to include tablets, the report mentioned.\\nAccording to Xu, the AI opportunity is attracting more vendors from the education and Internet sectors into the devices market, driving the development of kids' tablets with educational content in Mainland China. To drive stronger business outcomes, vendors must focus on market expansion and differentiation to enhance user experiences and outcomes. Leveraging on-device AI models will be particularly beneficial in this regard, according to the report.\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'Imagine a cutting-edge venue with the visual impact of a film festival, a museum\\'s sense of wonder and discovery, the multisensory bombardment of performance art and the intellectual challenge of an escape room — all wrapped up in a hyper-immersive story that reveals itself as you walk from room to room. That is Atlas9.\\nThe 46,000-square-foot, $26.7 million entertainment venue is being constructed as part of the Homefield project near 94th Street and State Avenue in Kansas City, Kansas. The project targets a grand opening next summer.\\nexpand\\nIt is the brainchild of Overland Park-based Dimensional Innovations, which built a reputation for creating unique and interesting building spaces and interactive exhibits ranging from the Kansas City Royals Hall of Fame to the Museum at Prairiefire to augmented-reality displays at American Century Investments\\' headquarters. The company teamed up with Swell Spark — operator of Blade & Timber ax-throwing facilities and Breakout KC — to operate Atlas9. Quixotic, the Kanas City-based performance art collective, will add its unique expertise to the project, as well.\\n\\'What we do is create remarkable experiences, and most of the time those are nonfiction stories,\\' Dimensional Innovations CEO Tucker Trotter said. \\'This is an opportunity to create something that\\'s completely based on fiction. We believe people need experiences now more than ever, and we get to create something where they\\'re going to be a part of the story. We don\\'t always get that much flexibility. It puts a tremendous amount of pressure on us, but it\\'s been really fun and fueled a lot of the passions and energy of our internal team. Everyone wants to work on this project because it\\'s so exciting.\\'\\nexpand\\nTrotter said Atlas 9 will draw from everything his organization learned since it was founded in 1993. It will pay homage to the company\\'s roots of helping AMC Theaters build interesting megaplexes and combine years of experience creating cutting-edge interactive exhibits for museums, children\\'s hospitals and professional sports venues.\\nThe company\\'s work, if not its name, has fans nationwide. Sports fans know it for projects like an updated Minnie & Paul Celebration sign and new 12-foot-diameter baseball-shaped sign at the Minnesota Twins\\' Target Field home or the newly iconic Al Davis Memorial Torch in Las Vegas\\' Allegiant Stadium. Children and parents have been positively distracted by decorations and interactive displays at children\\'s hospitals in Kansas City and Columbia and an immersive CreatureVerse at the Connecticut Children\\'s Medical Center. Tourists see the company\\'s handiwork in a life-sized dinosaur bursting out of the side of the Arizona Museum of Natural History and Malala exhibit at the Children\\'s Museum of Indianapolis.\\nHere\\'s a look at Dimensional Innovations\\' diverse portfolio of creations.\\nView Slideshow 13 photos\\nexpand\\nexpand\\nexpand\\nexpand\\nexpand\\nexpand\\nexpand\\nRandall Statler, creative director for Dimensional Innovations, leads the effort on Atlas9. His vision is to create a building full of rooms that each offer a unique experience. Guests can choose which direction to go, and their choices drive the overarching story thread.\\n\\'You\\'re basically walking through this and unpacking this narrative story in a nonlinear way,\\' Statler said. \\'If you take a left, you\\'re going to interpret and digest the narrative in a different way than the person who goes right. So everyone might meet in the middle and have a different tack on where they\\'ve been and where they\\'re going to go.\\'\\nStatler envisions rooms incorporating art, light, sound, moving imagery and performances by Quixotic.\\nSwell Spark CEO Matt Baysinger said the venue leans heavily on Kansas City\\'s artistic community.\\n\"There will be people who show up just because they want to see the incredible art, which is why some people will put this in the museum category,\\' Baysinger said. \\'But we also know that calling it a museum doesn\\'t do justice for what this thing actually is because it\\'s a hyper-immersive activity. All of us at Dimensional Innovations, Quixotic and Swell Spark are experience enthusiasts. This isn\\'t something that you go to, walk around, look at the art and say, \\'That\\'s cool.\\' It\\'s deeper and richer than that because you get to actually experience and interact with the artistic components themselves.\\'\\nexpand\\nBaysinger called Atlas9 one of the most rewarding projects he\\'s worked on in the past decade. He called the people working on it a \\'dream team\\' that considers all ideas, even if they seem impossible.\\n\\'It\\'s been really fun to realize what we are capable of, sometimes in a scary way,\\' Baysinger said. \\'Some of the ideas come out, and I\\'ll scratch my head because the logistics and complications of putting it together seem asinine, and I\\'m thinking there is no way to do it. Then Randall (Statler) comes back after the weekend and says his team figured it out and all the technology works. Quixotic is a big part of it, as well, and we get to work alongside some of the most incredible performers on Earth, who will be woven into the fabric of Atlas9, as well. Folks are going to come into this with expectations that it is small and realize as soon as they step through the door that what we\\'re doing here is big.\\'\\nThe goals for Atlas9 certainly aren\\'t small. It\\'s designers want it to be one of Kansas City\\'s top attractions, right up there with barbecue and the Kansas City Chiefs. They hope it becomes a must-see venue not only for people in the Kansas City area, but worldwide. It\\'s intentionally targeting an opening before Kansas City hosts matches for the 2026 World Cup to give it the best opportunity to make an impression in a global way.\\n\\'We want this to speak to the modernity of the local art scene,\\' Statler said. \\'Kansas City has already been on the trajectory of establishing artistic credibility on a regional and national stage. This is the right time and the right thing to reward that inertia and have it really pay off. It just feels natural and right.\\'',\n",

       "   'summary': 'Indianapolis Colts\\nIt\\'s officially gameday for the Indianapolis Colts (1-2) and Pittsburgh Steelers (3-0), as the hosts look to build momentum and stack a second consecutive win while the Steelers attempt to remain undefeated.\\nThe two teams faced off late last season in a big 30-13 Colts victory, but these two teams are much different this time around.\\nHere is everything you need to know about this Sunday\\'s battle between the Colts and Steelers.\\nDate/Time: Sunday, Sept. 29, at 1:00pm ET\\nWhere: Indianapolis, Ind.; Lucas Oil Stadium\\nTelevision: CBS — Spero Dedes (play-by-play), Adam Archuleta (color), Aditi Kinkhabwala (sideline)\\nTo find out what games will be on in your area on Sunday, check here\\nRadio: WFNI 1070-AM The Fan, WLHK 97.1 HANK FM — Matt Taylor (play-by-play), Rick Venturi (color), Larra Overton (sideline)\\nSteelers lead, 21-7.

After Pittsburgh\\'s last game, Harris was seen in the locker room with a sling over his arm. Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said there would be \"no limitations for Naj\" heading into Week 4. If he isn\\'t fully healthy, the Colts\\' defense needs to take advantage of playing against a worsened rushing attack. Backup running back Jaylen Warren will also miss the game for Pittsburgh, making it an ideal situation for a Colts run defense that had a bounce-back performance last week. On top of running back injuries, the Steelers will be without starting guard Isaac Seumalo. It\\'ll be backups against backups in the trenches on Sunday afternoon.\\nStop Drives in the Red Zone: The Steelers\\' offense has the worst red zone conversion rate in the league, only turning 25% of their trips into touchdowns. Living on field goals isn\\'t sustainable for any team, making it ultra-important that the Colts\\' defense kills drives before they turn into six points. The secondary will play a big part in this, especially when looking at the Pittsburgh receiving corps. George Pickens stands out as the main red zone threat, but no other Steelers receiver is listed as over 6-foot-1. If the Colts can clamp down on a smaller group of pass catchers, it would help take some weight off the expectations of Anthony Richardson and the Indianapolis offense.\\nForce Justin Fields to Throw it Deep: The Steelers are ranked in the bottom 10 of the league in yards per attempt, meaning short passes are the lifeblood of the offense. Forcing Justin Fields to make risky reads would help the Colts\\' defense a lot, especially if he is forced to aim it toward safety Julian Blackmon. In Gus Bradley\\'s defense, that may be a tough ask. Sitting in a zone means the quarterback prefers to find the empty space, which usually isn\\'t deep down the field. Changing up the scheme a little bit could help Colts defenders make big-time plays against a quarterback who\\'s only turned the ball over twice this season. Time of possession has not supported the Colts in the past, so small plays that add up could be poisonous for Indy. Forcing 50-50 balls is a necessity for the defense so they can stay off the field and keep the rock in Richardson\\'s hands.Retractable roof/window stadium (closed).

       "   'summary': \"Here's a look at how the snap counts and performance grades shook out for the Sooners on both sides of the ball.\\nThat victory was improbable in part because of the injuries. The Sooners were without five receivers and Taylor Tatum , while the defense was missing starting cheetah Kendel Dolby . That led to the Sooners playing several depth pieces on both sides of the ball.\\nAUBURN, Alabama — The Sooners somehow escaped with a 27-21 win over Auburn on Saturday, scoring 17 unanswered points to rally late and stun the Tigers.\\n1. Gavin Sawchuk... as the third-down running back?\\nWith Taylor Tatum unavailable, it was expected that Sawchuk would see an increase in snaps. He saw 19 snaps against Auburn, a significant uptick from the seven he saw against Tennessee.\\nHowever, he wasn't really utilized as ball-carrier. The Sooners essentially utilized him as a third-down running back primarily tasked with pass blocking. 13 of his 19 snaps came on passing downs and he ran nine routes, though he wasn't targeted. He's also credited with seven snaps, though those likely came on scrambles from Michael Hawkins.\\nSawchuk only saw one carry and it was his best of the season, as he gashed Auburn for 16 yards. But the play was called back on a hold by Jake Roberts. Therefore, Sawchuk was not credited with any rushing attempts.\\nJovantae Barnes continues to operate as the Sooners' clear running back. He made his second consecutive start and played 37 snaps, recording all 18 of the running back carries. Even with Tatum out, the Sooners simply didn't look for any other running backs to run the ball. Sam Franklin and Kalib Hicks never saw the field.\\nBarring any unexpected developments, it's clear that the backfield belongs to Barnes and Tatum.\\n2. Woodi Washington's snaps are going down\\nIf there's been anything noticeable about the Sooners' cornerback room, it's Washington. Specifically, his snaps are only going down. But the Sooners turned to Samuel Omosigho and Bowman to pick up the slack at cheetah.\\nHere are his snap counts over the last four weeks: 50, 46, 40, 34. His 34 snaps against Auburn were a season low, and that came despite Kendel Dolby and Gentry Williams both missing the game. He also didn't start against the Tigers.\\nThe Sooners have been content to use Kani Walker and Dez Malone at cornerback, even as both have had their struggles. Both got burned for long touchdowns against the Tigers, though Malone had a significantly better grade than Walker. Eli Bowen did play 29 snaps, a slight uptick from the 23 he played against Tennessee.\\nIt just hasn't been the best season for Washington thus far.\\n3. Bauer Sharp bounce-back game\\nSharp took full responsibility for his poor showing against Tennessee, where he struggled with blocking and had a costly drop.\\nAccording to the stats, it was a complete 180 for Sharp. He not only led the Sooners in receptions (4 for 43), but he had the highest performance grade on the offense by far. He also had a 70.0 pass-blocking grade a team-best 69.0 run-blocking grade.\\nThe rest of the tight end room was subpar. Jake Roberts accounted for two penalties and Kade McIntyre, who had the lowest PFF grade, had one. On the Sooners' first series of the fourth quarter, Roberts and McIntyre committed costly penalties on back-to-back plays that contributed to a turnover on downs. Neither of them caught a pass.\",\n",

Both support LiveAndLetsFly.com.\\nIf you haven't followed us on Facebook or Instagram, add us today. Southwest Airlines Former Identity\\nIn 1990s, Southwest moved from a quiet little niche Texas airline to a national powerhouse. The Southwest Effect would lower fares in a new city as the airline expanded by an average of 15% and increased travelers through that airport by 28-30%. The no frills approach was an inferior offering to network carriers at the time who were still offering two checked bags, meals in coach even on short flights, and point-to-point service over congested hub and spoke models.\\nAs the market changed, mostly after September 11th, Southwest stayed the same. What once was a constant compromise for travelers using secondary airports (Manchester, New Hampshire instead of Boston Logan) and forgoing service onboard, became industry-leading with included luggage, one of the most widespread internet install bases, and a cancellation policy that has long allowed travelers to hold onto their value for a future trip.\\nThey were also less expensive, but that's not been the case for more than a decade. Southwest and IcelandAir Partnership\\nSouthwest Airlines and IcelandAir announced a partnership that will take flight in 2025. It will allow Southwest flyers to book and redeem for flights to Europe and for European travelers to reach greater US destinations. Many of Southwest's destinations are already served by IcelandAir in a meaningful way offering greater onward connections. Several of those 14 North American destinations are in focus cities for Southwest's network such as Denver (DEN), Baltimore (BWI), Nashville (BNA), and Orlando (MCO.)\\nThis is not the first time that Southwest has joined forces with a foreign carrier. Southwest's initial partner was when it codeshared with WestJet for some time before ending the airline partnership. It also sought a tie-up with Volaris in 2009 for onward service throughout Mexico.\\nIcelandAir may be different than the others because its customer base has changed. Now, the airline flies into major hubs it fought hard to avoid such as LaGuardia, Dallas/Fort Worth, and Chicago O'Hare. It serves more business flyers than ever before (though they are pulling back some now.) Seating Plan Fully Unveiled\\nIts signature 'sit wherever you want' cattle call has been retired in favor assigned seating. This is, of course, to drive and segment revenue. Assigned seats with access to more space will coincide with more expensive fares, and in time with the ability to buy up just the better seat assignment. Premium seats for now are limited to more space in some coach seats while reducing space throughout the rest of the cabin.\\nWhen Southwest announced the assigned seating plan, some had believed it was solely to expedite seating, reward more frequent customers, or those flying on higher value fares. But it's clear that's not going to be the case.\\nThe airline has, for now, stated it will keep two free checked bags, but like everything else in the march toward improving shareholder value will be subject to investor approval.\\nAll of the moves that the carrier has made are standard network carrier moves because it's facing standard network carrier problems. American, Delta, and United have 952, 947, and 924 aircraft respectively. Southwest comes in fourth at 814, a sizable fleet. For comparison, the next closest carrier is SkyWest (which serves the others on feeder flights) at just less than 500. Alaska comes in at 365 (426 with Hawaiian.) Southwest had 171 million enplaned passengers, ahead of United by 7 million in 2023.\\nJust as the other carriers have found value in segmenting passengers and ancillary revenue, so too is Southwest – the last hold out – joining the ranks. Who The Carrier Is Now, And What's Next?\\nSouthwest is at a confusing juxtaposition. In order to continue to grow, it's going to need to further segment, offer something below its mostly included model, and add further partnerships. The airline has few destinations in the United States for which it can continue to add meaningful seats and revenue. And as its customer base changes, so too will its partnerships. Past relationships were to serve near field markets on leisure routes. The future is going to be offering something more premium.\\nAlaska demonstrated a model of adding partners across alliances (before it joined oneworld) that helped its customers move around the world on airline partners like Air France, British Airways, and Emirates. While onward connections likely helped Emirates passengers get elsewhere in North America, redemptions were likely the reason that partnership devolved.\\nToday, some Southwest passengers want to go to Paris, London, or Rome and before the IcelandAir partnership, they have to choose other carriers for those destinations. This is the lowest hanging fruit, but is it enough? I'd argue that Southwest customers probably want to go deeper throughout the Caribbean than the handful of destinations the airline offers. Perhaps it's helpful to look outside of airline relationships too like cruise lines, and hotel chains. Hyatt and American have found success in their relationship, Marriott and United have a deal, Delta and SPG pioneered this type of partnership. Maybe Southwest and Hilton will get together. Maybe something a little more unique like Sandals/Beaches resorts as Southwest flies to many of Sandals' resort destinations.\\nAs crazy as it sounds, Southwest may have to consider an alliance membership too. Southwest is large enough to become an anchor for a new alliance and there are likeminded carriers without an alliance that could help Southwest expand its wings, and for global carriers to gain access to more US destinations. Attractive global carriers like Emirates, Etihad, Starlux, and IcelandAir could help to build a broader footprint. As we've seen in recent years, some carriers like SAS, have switched from one to another, that too could happen.\\nWe can't forget the comments that Southwest's Boeing exposure has put the airline in a compromised situation. This could mean new airframes from Airbus. And while we are breaking the aircraft mold Southwest has occupied, we may also want to find some products better suited to its missions, including A220s for longer, narrow markets.\\nThe only thing we know for sure is that Southwest will have to continue to evolve in a way that it hasn't before. It's not the same Southwest it has been and probably shouldn't be thought of as such.\\nWhat do you think?\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"With a dockworkers' strike threatening to close ports on the East and Gulf coasts beginning this week, Chris Butler is growing worried.\\nButler is CEO of the National Tree Company, and, like many businesses, his is counting on shipments that are en route from Asia but won't reach their ports before an expected strike by longshoremen starting at 12:01 a.m. Eastern time Tuesday.\\nThe company, based in New Jersey, is an importer of artificial Christmas trees and other holiday decorations. If a strike were to last just a few days, there might be time afterward to unload the trees, transport them to warehouses and have them ready for customers this season.\\nYet if a strike were to keep ports closed until, say, November, about 150,000 trees might not arrive in time for the peak shopping season, imposing costs on National Tree and other businesses. In a worst-case scenario, those costs, multiplied across industries, could fuel inflation and pressure the U.S. economy.\\n'Definitely not an ideal situation,' Butler said.\\nNational Tree already has stockpiled or delivered most of the roughly 2 million artificial trees it sells each year. But it would lose revenue if 150,000 of the trees got stuck in the pipeline.\\nOther businesses face the same predicament, with goods that could be stranded at sea if 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen's Association make good on their threat to strike. They could shut down 36 ports from Maine to Texas that handle about half the goods shipped into and out of the United States. (West Coast dockworkers belong to a different union and aren't involved in the strike.)\\nA prolonged strike would force companies to pay shippers for the delays, and goods could arrive too late for the high point of holiday shopping season. On Friday, top Biden administration officials met with port operators and told them they should negotiate with the union ahead of Tuesday, according to a White House official who insisted on anonymity to discuss an ongoing meeting.\\nButler says he's hoping for an agreement or for government intervention to halt a strike. But the U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents shippers and ports, and the longshoremen's union haven't met since June. And no talks are scheduled.\\nThe union is demanding significantly higher wages and a total ban on the automation of cranes, gates and moving containers in the loading and unloading of freight.\\nThe Toy Association, the nation's leading toy trade group, was among about 200 organizations that asked President Joe Biden in a letter this month to work with both sides to reach an agreement. The National Grain and Feed Association also urged Biden to take action to avert a strike, which would come just as harvest season gets underway.\\nTheir push has put Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, in a sensitive position: Both have courted union support and don't want to be seen as pressuring the longshoremen to reach a settlement. Yet if an extended strike were to cause shortages of consumer goods or fuel high inflation, it could cost Harris votes in the November election.\\nUnder the Taft-Hartley Act, Biden could seek a court order to suspend the strike for an 80-day cooling-off period. Robyn Patterson, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement that the administration has never invoked the act and isn't considering it now.\\nBiden and Congress did step in two years ago to block a looming freight rail strike and force those workers to accept a deal because of widespread fears that a rail strike would have damaged the economy.\\nAlex Hertel-Fernandez, an associate professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University who served as a Labor Department official under Biden, suggested that the administration will follow the playbook it used in talks last year between West Coast ports and the union there: Mediating negotiations without directly intervening.\\nGreg Ahearn, CEO of the Toy Association, said a strike would happen at a critical moment for toy sellers and makers: Up to 60% of annual sales occur from October through December. Though some toy companies shipped goods earlier, Ahearn said a strike would make it hard to replenish hot-selling items.\\nA strike, he warned, could raise toy prices 'based on scarcity and increased costs.'\\nAt National Tree, Butler and his crew began preparing for a strike in July. They accelerated shipments for everything they could. But one major retail client, he said, asked for trees early. And until recently, factories in China and elsewhere couldn't produce the rest of National Tree's orders.\\nShips containing the trees are on the way to New York but won't get there before Tuesday. A prolonged strike, Butler said, would force most of the trees to be warehoused until next Christmas season.\\nA longshoremen's strike would further distress a global supply chain that has already endured slowdowns from attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels on commercial shipping. Those attacks have all but shut down the use of the Red Sea and Suez Canal, said Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation. The attacks are forcing longer transit times for vessels that must navigate around the Cape of Good Hope to reach East Coast and Gulf Coast ports.\\nA dockworkers' strike, Gold said, could prove even more damaging than the pandemic-induced port congestion in 2021 and 2022, when cargo was allowed to move, albeit slowly.\\nEastern ports could be left at a standstill. Gold noted that carriers are already announcing surcharges on containers to address potential disruptions, a trend that could elevate inflation.\\nMany retailers might find it difficult to charge customers more to make up for those expenses. Most vulnerable, Gold said, would be small businesses that don't import directly and lack the financial resources to incur higher costs.\\nShippers could reroute some cargo to West Coast ports. But those ports couldn't come close to absorbing the additional cargo. The Port of Los Angeles, for example, moved 960,000 containers in August — about 80% of its capacity — said Gene Seroka, its executive director.\\nThe major Western railroads, Union Pacific and BNSF, have added capacity to their systems to handle more freight as imports have increased. Eastern railroads CSX and Norfolk Southern say they can move cars and crews to handle more freight coming to Chicago from the West. But it's not clear just how much more the railroads can manage.\\nIn any case, Butler said, it would be too costly for him to ship trees across the country by rail.\\nTaylor Green, co-founder of landscaping company Artificial Grass Solutions in Los Angeles, which imports artificial turf, said he bought 25% more turf than usual to ensure there would be enough for clients' projects. He also made arrangements with alternative suppliers in case the strike goes on indefinitely. If it does, Green said, price increases would likely be necessary.\\nStill, like some larger retailers and manufacturers, Artificial Grass says it's better prepared for shortages than it was during the pandemic.\\n'We've learned to be proactive rather than reactive,' Green said.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Things have not been going great for Kanye West lately. He just suffered massive financial losses thanks to selling his Malibu mansion. Kanye has been trying to sell the mansion for a while, and he just took a substantial loss on it with the amount he sold it for.\\nHere is what Kanye sold his mansion for and how much money he lost on the deal. Kanye Loses Millions By Selling Malibu Mansion\\nKanye West finally sold his Malibu mansion. However, if he thought he could make money off the sale, he was very wrong. Not only did he not make money, but he lost a great deal with the total that he finally got for the house. YouTube/Jimmy Kimmel Live\\nKanye had to drop the price he was asking by almost $15 million when no one made an offer to buy it from him. The biggest problem is there are a lot of problems with the mansion, which is considered to be 'crumbling.' When Kanye bought the mansion in 2021, he paid $57.3 million.\\nAfter he purchased the mansion, he gutted and abandoned it. Kanye later listed it for sale in December 2023. Since then, it has been sitting in escrow. Kanye initially listed the home for $53 million, trying to sell it for a little less than he paid. No one wanted it for that price.\\nFinally, in April, Kanye dropped the asking price to $39 million. According to Jason Oppenheim of the Oppenheim Group, whoever buys it will have to replace all the interior finishes, with Kanye gutted. That will cost millions (via The Hollywood Reporter ). 'On the positive, it can be brought up to 2024 standards — it was built about 10 years ago,' he said. Kanye West Faced Lawsuits Based On The Mansion\\nKanye West also faced several legal problems concerning the mansion. The person he hired to gut it sued him for unpaid fees. Contractor Tony Saxon claimed Kanye owed him more than $1 million for his work. Kanye denied the claims in the lawsuit. Kanye West-YouTube\\nIn January, Ron Zambrano, a partner at West Coast Employment Lawyers, filed a mechanics lien on the property on behalf of Saxon. They claimed he owed them more than $1 million and wanted to ensure he had the money to pay them back 'before he goes completely broke.' They said anyone who wanted to buy the mansion would have to go through them first to ensure they were paid.\\nWhile the interiors were gutted, the mansion's exterior is still in great shape, thanks to its concrete work. It is a 4,000-square-foot house with 1,500 square feet of exterior decks, all with Pacific Ocean views.\\nAre you surprised at how much Kanye West lost in the selling of his Malibu mansion?

       "   'excerpt': \"Internet 'evil twins' are stalking airport Wi-Fi connections and the cybercriminals behind the rising attacks are rarely caught.\",\n",
       "   'summary': 'Over the years, travelers have repeatedly been warned to avoid public Wi-Fi in places like airports and coffee shops. Airport Wi-Fi, in particular, is known to be a hacker honeypot, due to what is typically relatively lax security. But even though many people know they should stay away from free Wi-Fi, it proves as irresistible to travelers as it is to hackers, who are now updating an old cybercrime tactic to take advantage.\\nAn arrest in Australia over the summer set off alarm bells in the United States that cybercriminals are finding new ways to profit from what are called \"evil twin\" attacks. Also classified within a type of cybercrime called \"Man in the Middle\" attacks, evil twinning occurs when a hacker or hacking group sets up a fake Wi-Fi network, most often in public settings where many users can be expected to connect.\\nIn this instance, an Australian man was charged with conducting a Wi-Fi attack on domestic flights and airports in Perth, Melbourne, and Adelaide. He allegedly set up a fake Wi-Fi network to steal email or social media credentials.\\n\"As the general population becomes more accustomed to free Wi-Fi everywhere, you can expect evil twinning attacks to become more common,\" said Matt Radolec, vice president of incident response and cloud operations at data security firm Varonis, adding that no one reads the terms and conditions or checks the URLs on free Wi-Fi.\\n\"It\\'s almost a game to see how fast you can click \"accept\" and then \\'sign in\\' or \\'connect.\\' This is the ploy, especially when visiting a new location; a user might not even know what a legitimate site should look like when presented with a fake site,\" Radolec said.\\nOne of the dangers of today\\'s twinning attacks is that the technology is much easier to disguise. An evil twin can be a tiny device and can be tucked behind a display in a coffee shop, and the small device can have a significant impact.\\n\"A device like this can serve up a compelling copy of a valid login page, which could invite unwary device users to enter their username and password, which would then be collected for future exploitation,\" said Cincinnati-based IT consultant Brian Alcorn.\\nThe site doesn\\'t even have to actually log you in. \"Once you\\'ve entered your information, the deed is done,\" Alcorn said, adding that a harried, weary traveler probably would just think the airport Wi-Fi is having issues and not give it another thought.\\nPeople who are not careful with passwords, such as use of pet\\'s names or favorite sports teams as their password for everything, are even more vulnerable to an evil twin attack. Alcorn says for individuals who reuse username and password combinations online, once the credentials are obtained they can be fed into AI, where its power can quickly give cybercriminals the key.\\n\"You are susceptible to exploitation by someone with less than $500 in equipment and less skill than you might imagine,\" Alcorn said. \"The attacker just has to be motivated with basic IT skills.\"\\nWhen in public places, experts say it\\'s best to use alternatives to public WiFi networks.\\n\"My favorite way to avoid evil twin attacks is to use your phone\\'s mobile hotspot if possible,\" said Brian Callahan, Director of the Rensselaer Cybersecurity Collaboratory at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.\\nUsers would be able to spot an attack if through a phone relying on its mobile data and sharing it via a mobile hotspot.\\n\"You will know the name of that network since you made it, and you can put a strong password that only you know on it to connect,\" Callahan said.\\nIf a hotspot isn\\'t an option, a VPN can also provide some protection, Callahan said, as traffic should be encrypted to and from the VPN.\\n\"So even if someone else can see the data, they can\\'t do anything about it,\" he said.\\nAt many airports, the responsibility for WiFi is outsourced and the airport itself has little if any involvement in safeguarding it. At Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, for example, Boingo is the Wi-Fi provider.\\n\"The airport\\'s IT team does not have access to their systems, nor can we see usage and dashboards,\" For said an airport spokesman. \"The network is isolated from DAL\\'s systems as it is a separate standalone system with no direct connection to any of the City of Dallas\\' networks or systems internally.\"\\nA spokeswoman for Boingo, which provides service to approximately 60 airports in North America, said it can identify rogue Wi-Fi access points through its network management. \"The best way passengers can be protected is by using Passpoint, which uses encryption to automatically connect users to authenticated Wi-Fi for a safe online experience,\" she said, adding that Boingo has offered Passpoint since 2012 to enhance Wi-Fi security and eliminate the risk of connecting to malicious hotspots.\\nAlcorn says evil twin attacks are \"definitely\" occurring with regularity in the United States, it\\'s just rare for someone to get caught because they are such stealth attacks. And sometimes hackers use these attacks as a learning model. \"Many evil twin attacks may be experimental by individuals with novice-to-intermediate skills just to see if they can do it and get away with it, even if they don\\'t use the collected information right away,\" he said.\\nThe surprise in Australia wasn\\'t the evil twinning attack itself, but the arrest.\\n\"This incident isn\\'t unique, but it is unusual that the suspect was arrested,\" said Aaron Walton, threat analyst at Expel, a managed services security company. \"Generally, airlines are not equipped and prepared to handle or mediate hacking accusations. The typical lack of arrests and punitive action should motivate travelers to exercise caution with their own data, knowing what a tempting and usually unguarded -target it is — especially at the airport.\"\\nIn the Australian case, according to Australian Federal Police, dozens of people had their credentials stolen.\\nAccording to a press release from the AFP, \"When people tried to connect their devices to the free WiFi networks, they were taken to a fake webpage requiring them to sign in using their email or social media logins. Those details were then allegedly saved to the man\\'s devices.\"\\nOnce those credentials were harvested, they could be used to extract more information from the victims, including bank account information.\\nFor hackers to be successful, they don\\'t have to dupe everyone. If they can persuade only a handful of people – statistically easy to do when thousands of harried and hurried people are milling around an airport – they will succeed.\\n\"We expect WI-Fi to be everywhere. When you go to a hotel, or an airport, or a coffee shop, or even just out and about, we expect there to be Wi-Fi and often freely available WI-FI,\" Callahan said. \"After all, what\\'s yet another network name in the long list when you\\'re at an airport? An attacker doesn\\'t need everyone to connect to their evil twin, only some people who go on to put credentials into websites that can be stolen.\"\\nThe next time you\\'re at the airport, the only way to be 100% sure you\\'re safe is to bring your own Wi-Fi.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"Tom Cruise shocked fans at a recent screening of Top Gun: Maverick, sharing his gratitude for them and the crew.\\nHe feels the need – the need to please! Tom Cruise pulled another all-star stunt over the weekend, making a surprise appearance at a screening of Top Gun: Maverick . As if that wasn't cool enough, the showing itself was backed by a live orchestra performing the movie's score.\\nWith nearly 3,000 people in attendance, Tom Cruise's surprise spot was an insanely huge hit within the famed Royal Albert Hall in London. During his introduction, Cruise expressed excitement at the rarity and history that the live music added to Top Gun: Maverick , noting its usage during the silent era.\\nWhile live musical accompaniments to modern films (that's talkies, ya see) have become more popular over the years and it's not uncommon to find them during special occasions (many theaters, for example, do Harry Potter films around Christmas), Cruise said that this particular screening of the Top Gun sequel would allow him to fulfill a lifelong desire. 'I've always wanted to experience a film like this with a live full symphony orchestra, synchronized picture, in front of a packed audience in the grandeur of a classic movie palace. Thank you all for being here, and thank you for making this dream come true.' He even sat at the theater's pipe organ, no doubt taking cues from his old pal Nick Nightingale.\\nCruise, ever the champion of cinema, also expressed his thanks to those behind the scenes of Top Gun: Maverick – both the film and the special screening. 'The power of music and its use in cinema to deepen our experience of the story and our connection to the characters is absolutely magical. And the music you're about to hear live tonight, I want to personally thank the extraordinary talents of Harold Faltermeyer, Hans Zimmer, Lady Gaga, OneRepublic, and the gentleman who's here this evening who also produced the score, Lorne Balfe. I also want to thank tonight's orchestra and all of your exceptional talents.'\\nA box office smash at $1.5 billion worldwide and one of the best films of 2022, Top Gun: Maverick was just what both movie theaters and moviegoers needed that year. Now, will we see a Top Gun 3 ?\\nHave you ever seen a movie with live music accompaniment? Share your experience with us!\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"GREG COTE'S HOT BUTTON TOP 10 (SEPTEMBER 29): WHAT IN SPORTS HAS GRABBED US THIS WEEK: Our Sunday Hot Button Top 10 notes column brings you what's on our minds, locally and nationally, but from a Miami perspective and accentuating stuff that's big, weird, damnable, funny or otherwise worth needling as the sports week just past pivots to the week ahead. Welcome to the 75th edition of your Sunday sports-potpourri notes column, the HB10:\\n1. DOLPHINS: Miami tabs Snoop as top Dogg for Monday night: Quarterback Tyler (Snoop) Huntley will be behind center Monday night as the Dolphins host Tennessee, replacing injured starter Tua Tagovailoa and injured backup Skylar Thompson. The 1-2 Fins have nudged up as from a 1- to a 2-point favorite against the winless Titans. Miami lucks to face a winnable four-game schedule stretch with the Patriots, Colts and Cardinals to follow.\\n2. HURRICANES: Lucky, last-second win in ACC opener the reality check UM needed: No. 7 Miami is a 5-0 team lucky to not be 4-1 after Friday night's 38-34 home escape vs. Virginia Tech in the ACC opener. Official ruled Tech scored the winning pass on a Hail Mary as time expired but the call was controversially overturned on review. Canes had outscored their first four opponents 207-41, and I'd put Friday's scare in the beneficial wakeup call/reality check category with challenging road trips to Cal and then No. 15 Louisville on deck.\\n3. MARLINS: Fish flush season today; Skip out; MLB playoffs on deck: The fire-sale Fish flush another sad season down the commode today at 61-100 entering the finale in Toronto. Miami manager Skip Schumaker is out as expected in a mutual parting. MLB postseason finds Shohei Ohtani's Dodgers the betting fave to win the World Series followed by the Yankees and Phillies. Playoffs open with four wild-card games Tuesday -- with the NL's Braves, Mets and Diamondbacks fighting down to the dramatic last day for the final two WC spots.\\n4. INTER MIAMI: Messi scores for draw; team can clinch Supporters Shield Wednesday: Lionel Messi's goal in the 67th minute Saturday forged a 1-1 home draw with Charlotte and enabled Inter Miami on Wednesday at Columbus to clinch the MLS Supporters Shield for best season record in the league. Miami then finishes at Toronto and home vs. New England before the playoffs begins. Herons are healthy betting favorites to win the franchise's first MLS Cup championship.\\n5. WNBA: Caitlin Clark eliminated; playoffs decide to go on anyway: Rookie sensation Clark's Indiana Fever were eliminated 2-0 in the playoffs' first round as America mourned -- but the postseason, though diminished, bravely carries anyway. It's New York Liberty vs. two-time defending champ Las Vegas Aces and Minnesota Lynx vs. Connecticut Sun in the conference finals starting today/Sunday. As for the Caitlin Effect: WNBA enjoyed its best attendance in 22 years, sellouts were up 242 percent, TV viewership was the best in 24 years, and merch sales spiked by 601%.\\n6. PANTHERS: Stanley Cup champ Cats nine days from NHL opener: The Panthers are 3-2 in the preseason after Saturday's win vs. Carolina, with three practice games left starting Monday vs. Tampa. The champs begin defense of their Stanley Cup for real in nine days, October 8 at home vs. Boston -- the polar opposite of a soft opening. Cats eliminated the Bruins 4-2 in the second round of the '24 playoffs in the most physical test of the postseason.\\n7. TENNIS: Billie Jean King awarded major U.S. honor: For her career on the court and perhaps more so off it, Billie Jean King has received the Congressional Gold Medal -- the first individual woman athlete so honored. President Joe Biden signed the legislation recognizing King's groundbreaking contributions. Now 80, King won 12 Grand Slam single titles and also blazed trails in gender equality, equal pay and women's and LGBTQ rights. A big life well led -- and thankfully still going.\\n8. HEAT: As preseason nears, shade on Miami's new alternate jersey: Every NBA team will introduce new 'City Edition' alternate jerseys this season. The website SB Nation ranked them and the Miami Heat's CE threads are one of five teams graded last in the F-tier with Heat listed at the very bottom. It's a red, sleeveless jersey with 'Heat' in small letters below 'CULTURE' in bigger script. I don't hate it but it is an extra heavy lean on the whole Heat Culture thing, which drives some folks nuts. (Team stages its media day Monday ahead of its preseason opener October 8.)\\n9. GOLF: Company benefiting from Tiger's name sues Tiger in trademark dispute: A company that sells helmet-cooling products for athletes called Tigeraire is suing Tiger Woods' apparel brand Sun Day Red in a trademark dispute, claiming the brand 'unlawfully hijacked' its logo design. (Both designs show a silhouette of a tiger.) Sports word association with the word 'tiger' = Tiger Woods. Dear Tigeraire: Who's ripping off who?\\n10. OLYMPICS: The value of a gold medal to one man in Hungary: Hungarian fencer László Csongrádi won gold in men's team sabre at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. This month, his prize was stolen when his home was broken into as he slept. Now 65, Csongrádi so badly wants his medal back he has offered, upon his death, to leave it in his will to the thief who stole it if it is returned. 'I want him to return the object that means nothing to him,' he said. The medal would be returned with no such macabre strings attached, if only there was honor among thieves.\\nNEW HB10 FEATURE: THE LIST: 'The List' will bring you something unexpected every Sunday. Our debut:\\nTHE LIST: DOLPHINS QB DURABILITY: Miami quarterbacks who have started every game in a season:\\nNumber of times / Player (Seasons)\\n11 / Dan Marino (1984-86, '88-92, '94, '97-98)\\n4 / Ryan Tannehill (2012-15)\\n2 / Bob Griese (1970, '77)\\n1 each / David Woodley 1982*, Jay Fiedler 2001, Chad Pennington 2008, Tua Tagovailoa 2023. *-Strike-shortened season.\\nOther most recent stuff from me: No. 7 Hurricanes get lucky & get wakeup call in 38-34 win over Virginia Tech // Dolphins have talent to win even with QB mess -- but must plan for life after Tua // NFL Week 4 picks // Are No. 7 Miami Hurricanes really as good as they've looked?

       "   'excerpt': 'Two airlines have extended their seasonal routes to Dublin from the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, although one will be using a smaller aircraft for the transatlantic flight.',\n",
       "   'summary': \"Two airlines have extended their seasonal routes to Dublin from the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, although one will be using a smaller aircraft for the transatlantic flight.\\nBoth Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) and Aer Lingus, which started routes to Dublin in April, will continue the route into 2025. The direct routes were originally announced as year-round flights, according to previous Business Journal reports. But both have seemingly switched to seasonal routes, with Aer Lingus and Delta stopping the direct flights by the end of this month, according to flight schedules.\\nAer Lingus' 2024 MSP to Dublin route has been using a widebody A330-200 airplane, which has a two-class configuration of 23 business class and 248 economy class seats. For 2025, the carrier plans to fly the route on a narrowbody Airbus A321XLR with 16 business class and 168 economy cabin seats.\\nAccording to an X post by Thrifty Traveler editor Kyle Potter, Aer Lingus will also increase the frequency of flights.\\nDelta will also continue its direct flight to Dublin, Potter said. Delta's Minneapolis-Dublin flight will continue to operate on a widebody Boeing 767-300 with 28 Delta One seats, 18 Premium Select seats, 21 Comfort Plus seats and 151 economy seats.\\nAer Lingus's flight will resume April 5, 2025, and increase its flights from four times a week to seven times a week. The Irish carrier will also resume its direct flights from Denver, increasing its frequency to six times weekly.\\nThe announcements follow Delta's recent revival of its direct flight to Rome from MSP in the summer of 2025. The Atlanta-based carrier announced it would add four weekly flights from MSP, its second-largest hub, to Rome from late May through late October. Delta briefly flew an MSP-to-Rome direct route in 2016, though it only lasted one summer.\\nDelta could also bring more European routes to MSP in the future.\\nDelta CEO Ed Bastian noted at the Airport Foundation MSP's State of the Airport Event this week that a direct route to Scandinavia could come soon. The Atlanta-based carrier has built a closer relationship with Scandinavian Airlines (known as SAS) after the Copenhagen-based airline switched to the same airline alliance as Delta.\\nJust this week, the two airlines signed a code-sharing agreement effective Sept. 25. The agreement allows Delta customers flying from North America to gain additional access to 50 destinations in Northern Europe beyond SAS's hubs in Copenhagen, Oslo and Stockholm. SAS customers will gain access to more than 150 destinations in North America via Delta's hubs in Atlanta, Boston, Los Angeles, New York and Seattle.\",\n",

But what does it mean for the backbone of America, our small businesses?\\nA new CNBC|SurveyMonkey study fielded just before the Fed announced its first rate cut, which was anticipated — though the exact size of the cut was not — offers a glimpse into the minds of these entrepreneurs. The quarterly snapshot of Main Street businesses reveals a mixed bag of cautious optimism alongside lingering concerns about inflation and rising costs. With a divisive presidential election on the horizon, the uncertainty is palpable.\\nFour in ten (38%) agreed that inflation continues to be the biggest risk to their business. This is nearly three times higher than the next highest risks, consumer demand (13%) and interest rates (10%).\\nNonetheless, the anticipated interest rate cuts also sparked a surge in confidence. A third (33%) of respondents believed that inflation had peaked, and overall optimism for inflation relief is the highest since the first quarter of this year.\\nThree in five (62%) small business owners expected some degree of impact on the business from the recent interest rate cuts, with 22% expecting a major impact, and 41% a minor impact. These cuts are fueling action among small business owners: 40% intended to increase investments, 37% planned to expand their business, and 26% said they would stock up on inventory. Only one in five planned on increasing employee wages or benefits (20%) or hiring more employees (17%).\\nKickstarted by the Fed's recent decision, there is evident hope for stability as the economy seems poised to take a big step in a positive direction.

Nine in ten (90%) of these owners support Harris as the Democrat candidate, revealing the stark political polarization that exists in this community.\\nOur study revealed a notable lack of enthusiasm for vice presidential candidates Tim Walz and JD Vance on both sides of the political aisle.\\nNearly four in ten (37%) small business owners thought that Vance would have a positive impact on their business, 13 points lower than Donald Trump (50%) but still higher than the Democratic vice presidential pick Walz (29%). Although both candidates saw majority support among small business owners from their respective parties (68% for Vance among Republican small business owners, and 67% for Walz among Democrat small business owners), presidential candidates generated stronger support within their respective parties (89% for Trump and 79% for Harris).\\nThe CNBC|SurveyMonkey study affirms that businesses are cautiously optimistic as they continue to navigate the crosswinds of this uncertain landscape. While interest rate cuts are driving optimism and owners plan to reinvest their business in various ways, it will be imperative to continue to monitor and analyze this group as election season heats up.\\n— By Eric Johnson, CEO, SurveyMonkey\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'Many Americans believe they need to earn a certain dollar amount to feel rich.\\nBut even if they hit that goal or surpass it, they may be disappointed to find out they still don\\'t feel satisfied with their finances, says Charles Chaffin, co-founder of the Financial Psychology Institute and a professor at Iowa State University.\\n\"The misconception is that there\\'s an actual number and when people hit that number, they\\'ll suddenly feel wealthy,\" he tells CNBC Make It. \"Wealth is a subjective experience and is more than just how much money you have.\"\\nIn fact, even millionaires don\\'t always feel well off financially, according to recent data from Northwestern Mutual\\'s 2024 Planning & Progress study. The study found that just 32% of American millionaires consider themselves wealthy.\\nWhile the elevated prices of everyday goods and other economic factors may be at play, elements such as your internal beliefs about money can also influence whether or not you feel wealthy no matter how much money you have in the bank, Chaffin says.\\nHere\\'s one reason why that happens and what to focus on instead to feel more satisfied with your money, according to Chaffin.\\nPeople who become millionaires tend to be \"money vigilant,\" Chaffin says.\\nMoney vigilance is one of the four money scripts coined by financial psychologists Brad and Ted Klontz. People who are money vigilant tend to consistently analyze how much money is coming into and going out of their accounts.\\n\"They\\'re very much monitoring their spending and it\\'s been one of their great successes,\" Chaffin says. \"But the problem is they feel as if they\\'re not really secure yet.\"\\nDON\\'T MISS: How to master your money and grow your wealth\\nMillionaire or not, it\\'s necessary to keep an eye on your spending in order to avoid living above your means. But being \"hyper-focused\" on your spending can skew your perception of your financial state and may lead you to think you aren\\'t as well off as you actually are if you\\'re not careful, he says.\\n\"It\\'s no different than somebody who is obsessive about working out and they feel like they\\'re never, ever really in shape,\" Chaffin says.\\nWhether you\\'re aiming to save more cash or boost your overall earnings, it\\'s important to ask yourself what you hope to achieve by obtaining more money, Chaffin says. Otherwise, if you don\\'t change your internal money beliefs, you may still feel anxious about money even if you hit millionaire status.\\n\"If somebody says to me, \\'When I hit 2.7 million, I\\'m going to be wealthy,\\' my next question is, \\'Now what?\\'\" he says. \"What\\'s going to happen? What\\'s going to happen the next day? How\\'s that going to make your life better? Let\\'s be specific.\"\\nIf you\\'re able to cover your necessities daily and have a fully funded emergency fund, chances are you\\'re financially secure. But if you still don\\'t feel satisfied with your financial picture, it may be time to reassess what wealth looks like to you, Chaffin says.\\n\"You\\'ve got to have enough money to be secure but, at the same time, beyond that you should ask yourself what this money is for and what\\'s the purpose of it,\" he says.\\nSetting specific goals for what you hope to accomplish with your money can help you avoid feeling like \"enough is never enough,\" he says.\\nInstead of simply aiming to be a millionaire, you may set a goal to earn enough money to help your family or so that you can leave your job to travel the world, Chaffin says. Feeling wealthy isn\\'t always tied a specific dollar amount.\\n\"Some of the wealthiest people I know have very little money in their bank accounts, but they have a circle around them if anything ever goes wrong,\" he says. \"That\\'s also wealth.\"\\nWant to master your money this fall?

       "   'summary': 'As a financial advisor mom of three kids, I know well the power of compounded interest and the value of early work experience and learning to save and invest for yourself.\\nMy kids — ages 15, 12 and 11 — have been tutoring, filing, shredding, sweeping, and even researching and creating infographics for friends and our own companies for a while.\\nThis has not only helped them develop responsible work habits and meet deadlines around their usual school work and extracurricular activities, but it also gives them hands-on experience managing an income. It teaches them at an early age the value of saving for the future and prioritizing important goals such as retirement.\\nFor kids, that seems like eons away. But getting started early can offer tremendous advantages. Then, you might be wondering — like many of my clients do — what\\'s the best way to save for our kids?\\nI believe the answer is for them to save in their very own Roth individual retirement accounts.\\nYes, kids can have their own Roth IRA — and, just like for adults, the IRS rules are pretty straightforward.\\nFor 2024, the total contribution an individual under age 50 can make to any IRA account — whether Roth, traditional or some combination of the two — is $7,000. If someone\\'s earned income is less than that, they can contribute only up to the amount of income that they earned — no \"gift money.\"\\nWhile the child needs to have earned income to qualify for contributions, the money used to fund the Roth IRA can be contributed from someone else. This means the child can keep their earnings for immediate spending, while the Roth IRA is funded separately, helping them build a financial foundation without dipping into their own pockets.\\nParents, grandparents or any generous relative or benefactor can set up a Roth IRA for a child.\\nThere\\'s no minimum age requirement for contributing to a Roth IRA; if a child can earn money, they can have a Roth IRA.\\nBut if the child is a minor — under age 18 in most states but under age 21 in some — a parent or guardian must open a custodial Roth IRA in the child\\'s name and manage the investments until the child reaches the age of majority. Although the custodian makes decisions on the account, the child is the beneficial owner, meaning the funds must be used for their benefit.\\nMore about those income requirements: To contribute to a Roth IRA, the child must have earned income. This income could come from traditional employment, such as a part-time job, or from self-employment activities such as babysitting or lawn mowing. Money received from parents for chores or as an allowance does not count, nor do cash gifts.\\nMost kids, at least the younger ones, are unlikely to earn the $7,000 maximum allowable annual contribution for 2024 and are limited to the total amount they earned during the year.\\nEven if the child is not required to file an income tax return, the parent or other custodian must still keep careful records of the earnings that are used to contribute to the Roth. Self-employment income might be subject to additional taxes such as Medicare and Social Security. It\\'s wise to consult a tax professional to ensure compliance and maximize benefits.\\nI think of the Roth IRA as the \"golden egg\" savings vehicle for young people because not only is the account tax-sheltered, it also has the beneﬁt of liquidity.\\nA Roth can be treated like the long-term savings vehicle it is designed to be, but in case of an emergency, since kids have decades ahead of them before retirement, there are ways to access the contributions without penalties or other drawbacks.\\nEstablishing a Roth IRA for youngsters is a powerful way to set them on the path to financial security. By starting early, they can take full advantage of the benefits of tax-free growth, potentially amassing a significant retirement fund by the time they reach retirement age.\\nThere are other advantages as well. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so withdrawals during retirement can be tax-free, provided certain conditions are met. This is particularly advantageous for children, who are likely in a low or zero tax bracket now, which allows them to grow their investments without the burden of taxes.\\nIn addition, starting early allows the account to benefit from decades of compound interest, significantly growing the balance over time. For instance, if a 15-year-old contributes $2,000 annually until age 65, with an average annual return of 7%, the account could grow to nearly $1 million.\\nUnlike traditional IRAs, contributions to a Roth can be withdrawn at any time without penalties or taxes, and under certain circumstances, even earnings can be withdrawn without penalties for a first-time home purchase, for example.\\nAs another benefit, unlike traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs do not require withdrawals at a certain age, allowing the account to continue growing tax-free for as long as the owner chooses. This gives young people more control over their retirement funds and can be advantageous in managing their retirement income.\\nFurthermore, starting a Roth IRA can help young people learn about investing, saving and financial planning from an early age. The structure of a Roth IRA encourages a long-term outlook on finances, helping young people build a secure financial future.',\n",

This means the child can keep their earnings for immediate spending, while the Roth IRA is funded separately, helping them build a financial foundation without dipping into their own pockets.\\nParents, grandparents or any generous relative or benefactor can set up a Roth IRA for a child.\\nThere\\'s no minimum age requirement for contributing to a Roth IRA; if a child can earn money, they can have a Roth IRA.\\nBut if the child is a minor — under age 18 in most states but under age 21 in some — a parent or guardian must open a custodial Roth IRA in the child\\'s name and manage the investments until the child reaches the age of majority. Although the custodian makes decisions on the account, the child is the beneficial owner, meaning the funds must be used for their benefit.\\nMore about those income requirements: To contribute to a Roth IRA, the child must have earned income. This income could come from traditional employment, such as a part-time job, or from self-employment activities such as babysitting or lawn mowing. Money received from parents for chores or as an allowance does not count, nor do cash gifts.\\nMost kids, at least the younger ones, are unlikely to earn the $7,000 maximum allowable annual contribution for 2024 and are limited to the total amount they earned during the year.\\nEven if the child is not required to file an income tax return, the parent or other custodian must still keep careful records of the earnings that are used to contribute to the Roth. Self-employment income might be subject to additional taxes such as Medicare and Social Security. It\\'s wise to consult a tax professional to ensure compliance and maximize benefits.\\nI think of the Roth IRA as the \"golden egg\" savings vehicle for young people because not only is the account tax-sheltered, it also has the beneﬁt of liquidity.\\nA Roth can be treated like the long-term savings vehicle it is designed to be, but in case of an emergency, since kids have decades ahead of them before retirement, there are ways to access the contributions without penalties or other drawbacks.\\nEstablishing a Roth IRA for youngsters is a powerful way to set them on the path to financial security. By starting early, they can take full advantage of the benefits of tax-free growth, potentially amassing a significant retirement fund by the time they reach retirement age.\\nThere are other advantages as well. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so withdrawals during retirement can be tax-free, provided certain conditions are met. This is particularly advantageous for children, who are likely in a low or zero tax bracket now, which allows them to grow their investments without the burden of taxes.\\nIn addition, starting early allows the account to benefit from decades of compound interest, significantly growing the balance over time. For instance, if a 15-year-old contributes $2,000 annually until age 65, with an average annual return of 7%, the account could grow to nearly $1 million.\\nUnlike traditional IRAs, contributions to a Roth can be withdrawn at any time without penalties or taxes, and under certain circumstances, even earnings can be withdrawn without penalties for a first-time home purchase, for example.\\nAs another benefit, unlike traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs do not require withdrawals at a certain age, allowing the account to continue growing tax-free for as long as the owner chooses. This gives young people more control over their retirement funds and can be advantageous in managing their retirement income.\\nFurthermore, starting a Roth IRA can help young people learn about investing, saving and financial planning from an early age. The structure of a Roth IRA encourages a long-term outlook on finances, helping young people build a secure financial future.\\n— By Winnie Sun, co-founder and managing director of Irvine, California-based Sun Group Wealth Partners.

       "   'summary': 'October 31, 2024, has been set as the deadline date for all ten franchises of the Indian Premier League (IPL) to finalise their retention for the mega auction for the 2025 season. The IPL teams, using a combination of retention and Right-To-Match option, can retain up to six players from their 2024 squad - comprising a maximum of five capped players (India/overseas) and two uncapped Indians, based on the rules announced by the BCCI on Saturday, following a meeting of the IPL Governing Council in Bengaluru.\\n\"It is at the discretion of the IPL franchise to choose their combination for retentions and RTMs,\" the IPL release said. \\'The six retentions/RTMs can have a maximum of five capped players and a maximum of two uncapped players.\\'\\nIf a player makes his international debut before October 31, he will be considered capped. However, if he is retained by the franchise as an uncapped player, but makes his international debut before the IPL deadline, he will be considered uncapped and the team will only lose INR 4 crore from their purse. The BCCI also announced that the overall purse of all the teams have been increased by 33.34 per cent to INR 120 crore for the auction.\\nThe IPL also revived the \"uncapped player\" rule for the auction, which was discarded in 2021. According to the rule, as explained in the IPL statement released on Saturday, \"a capped Indian player will become uncapped, if the player has in the last five calendar years preceding the year in which the relevant Season is held, not played in the starting XI in International Cricket (Test match, ODI, Twenty20 International) or does not have a Central Contract with BCCI. This will be applicable for Indian Players only.\" The rule will hence allow Chennai Super Kings to retain their former captain MS Dhoni, who last played an international game in the 2019 World Cup and announced his retirement a year later, as an uncapped player.\\nRead more news like this on HindustanTimes.com',\n",

We are continuing the search and believe the remaining terrorists are foreign operatives.\"\\nThe incident occurred just a day after similar attacks in the same region, raising concerns about security during the upcoming third phase of assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. ADGP Jain assured that arrangements have been made to prevent any disruptions during the elections, stating, \"We are ensuring that no terror attacks or violence take place during the polling.\"\\nThe operation in Kathua remains ongoing as security forces comb the area for any remaining threats.',\n",

(Xinhua/Huang Zongzhi)\\nHANGZHOU, Sept. 29 (Xinhua) -- In the bustling \"Smart Africa\" pavilion at the third Global Digital Trade Expo held in east China\\'s Zhejiang Province, 27-year-old Mafu, wearing a traditional African-style head wrap, was passionately promoting authentic Ethiopian coffee beans via TikTok.\\nHer inspiring performance captured the attention of many curious onlookers. \"I mainly introduce overseas audiences to the origin, unique features and tasting techniques of our products, but most importantly, I highlight the discounts and favorable prices,\" said the young woman from South Africa.\\nAbout four months ago, Mafu arrived in China to study at Hangzhou Vocational & Technical College. This opportunity arose through a one-year talent training program focused on cross-border e-commerce.\\n\"I applied as soon as I saw the admission information online, and was lucky to be accepted. E-commerce has been growing rapidly in South Africa, and I want to learn everything about the industry here in China,\" she said.\\nXie Jijuan, head of the program, noted that over 200 African students have been trained through partnerships with several Chinese colleges and universities, with more than half already engaged in the e-commerce sector.\\nThe cultivation of e-commerce talent is considered a crucial aspect of deepening China-Africa cooperation.\\nSpeaking on African Digital Trade Day, a special event of the expo, Tang Wenhong, assistant minister of commerce, highlighted that China and Africa have conducted fruitful cooperation in e-commerce and other areas in recent years. He also noted how the two sides have established a solid foundation for future collaboration in the digital economy.\\nChinese companies have assisted African countries in constructing and upgrading a 150,000-km communications backbone network, which helps provide internet access for nearly 700 million users. Meanwhile, Chinese companies have also built mobile payment platforms serving tens of millions of African people, according to a white paper titled \"China and Africa in the New Era: A Partnership of Equals.\" © Provided by Xinhua This photo taken on Sept. 25, 2024 shows the China Pavilion at the third Global Digital Trade Expo in Hangzhou, east China\\'s Zhejiang Province. (Xinhua/Huang Zongzhi)\\nMany industry insiders believe that the spread of digital technologies, the ascent of e-commerce and the advancement of digital infrastructure have collectively ushered in unparalleled opportunities for Africa\\'s economic growth.\\nData from Statista, a global data and business intelligence platform, indicates that the African e-commerce industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 24.7 percent over the past seven years, with the industry\\'s annual revenue projected to exceed 42 billion U.S. dollars in 2024, up from just 7.7 billion dollars in 2017.\\nFurthermore, by 2030, at least 88 percent of Africans will own a smartphone, with 4G service adoption reaching 50 percent and that of 5G climbing to 17 percent, according to the latest report by the Global System for Mobile Communications.\\nIn Uganda, digital trade has opened doors for thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises, entrepreneurs and business leaders to access international markets.\\n\"The development of cross-border e-commerce between China and Africa has enabled Ugandan products such as coffee, tea and handicrafts to enter the Chinese market and has created more job opportunities and development space for us,\" said Oliver Wonekha, Uganda\\'s ambassador to China, who believes that digital trade will be a highlight of China-Africa cooperation in the future.\\nSeveral China-Africa cooperation agreements were signed on African Digital Trade Day, including projects for building a China-Africa digital trade platform, a co-creation plan for China-Africa media collaboration and an energy brand export initiative.\\n\"Madagascar is at a critical stage of digital transformation, and we are eager to work closely with Chinese companies to learn from China\\'s advanced experience in the digital economy,\" said Jean Louis Robinson, Madagascar\\'s ambassador to China.\\nHe added that there is enormous potential and space for cooperation between China and Africa, especially in e-commerce, digital infrastructure and technological innovation.\\nThemed \"Digital Trade, Global Access,\" the third Global Digital Trade Expo was held from Sept. 25 to 29 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province. The event is currently China\\'s only digital trade themed expo at the national level. China\\'s digital industry has seen robust growth in recent years, reporting a total revenue of 32.5 trillion yuan (about 4.6 trillion U.S. dollars) in 2023.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"NEW YORK (AP) — Global Citizen CEO Hugh Evans says the sense of urgency that younger generations bring to solving international challenges needs to be nurtured in the rest of the world.\\n'So many of the world's most prolific movements were started by people when they were young,' Hugh Evans said, noting that Martin Luther King Jr. was only 34 when he delivered his 'I Have a Dream' speech. 'Can you imagine that? (Nelson) Mandela was 26 when he co-founded the ANC Youth League. Malala (Yousafzai) was 11 when she gave her first protest speech. And my hero (William) Wilberforce was 21 when he entered into politics. So we have to get our skates on.'\\nThe Associated Press spoke with Evans shortly before Saturday's Global Citizen Festival in New York, am event headlined by superstars like Post Malone and Doja Cat, as well as breakout artists like Benson Boone and Rauw Alejandro. The festival generated more than $1 billion in new commitments to fight extreme poverty, as well as a new partnership with FIFA in which Global Citizen supporters get tickets to matches by taking action on humanitarian issues.\\nThe interview was edited for clarity and length. Q: Can you talk about the Global Citizen Festival's importance?\\nA: We're operating against the backdrop of a world with constant shocks -- the ongoing shock of recovering from the pandemic and now the shocks of global conflicts. That has resulted in the first time in our lifetime where poverty for the last three years has been on the increase. We're talking about 719 million people now living on less than $2.15 a day worldwide. The other big shock that the world hasn't yet fully experienced is the shock of climate change, which has the potential to push another 100 million people into extreme poverty in the next ten years. Q: You asked Global Citizen supporters to write their leaders about fully funding the World Bank's International Development Association. You want them to encourage Colombia to stop providing licenses to companies seeking to drill in the Amazon. And you're hoping to raise $250 million to provide education for 72 million kids currently out of school due to conflict.\\nA: Those are our big pushes this time. We want to address the reality that the world is confronting multiple crises at once. Q: During United Nations General Assembly Week last week, many groups did outreach to Generation Z. Global Citizen has done that for years.\\nA: Based on our most recent data, over 70% of our members are Gen Z. We need to continue to double down on that. It's fueled by the reality that I think we have a model of activism powered through the Global Citizen app that young people can relate to. And it gives them the power of putting activism and advocacy within their own hands. I think that our approach has always been to try to equip young people with the best, most thoughtful policy asks that are backed by incredible research and data and have the ability to have the most profound impact to bring an end to extreme poverty.\\nAssociated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

       "'China\\'s PC shipments nosedive 6% Amid Weak Demand\\nNone\\nNew Delhi: China\\'s PC shipments (including desktops, notebooks and workstations) fell by 6 per cent (year-on-year) to 9.1 million in the April-June quarter as weak demand continued. The country\\'s PC shipments declined by 6 per cent in Q2, with the consumer and commercial sectors falling by 3 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively, as per a Canalys report.\\nAnalyst Emma Xu said that the competitive dynamics of China\\'s PC market are rapidly increasing in complexity. \\'Local AI regulations have constrained the full deployment of Microsoft\\'s Copilot in Mainland China. This is pushing vendors toward localised strategies to develop AI PCs, either by integrating in-house AI assistants or by building their own AI application ecosystems through collaboration with developers,\\' Xu explained.\\nThe forecast anticipates 13 per cent penetration of AI-capable PCs in Greater China in 2024. According to the report, vendors will need to make consistent portfolio investments to execute on their AI PC roadmaps and adapt their go-to-market strategies to be flexible and localised to the unique market requirements.\\nIn contrast, tablet sales increased by 20 per cent to reach 7.8 million units in the April-June quarter, driven by increasing adoption and online promotions. The tablet market is highly competitive, as more smartphone vendors expand their portfolios to include tablets, the report mentioned.\\nAccording to Xu, the AI opportunity is attracting more vendors from the education and Internet sectors into the devices market, driving the development of kids\\' tablets with educational content in Mainland China. To drive stronger business outcomes, vendors must focus on market expansion and differentiation to enhance user experiences and outcomes. Leveraging on-device AI models will be particularly beneficial in this regard, according to the report.\\n\\nAtlas9 will bring an entertaining, immersive world to Kansas City, Kansas\\nThe brainchild of a \"dream team\" partnership between Dimensional Innovations, Swell Spark and Quixotic, Atlas9 promises to wow guests when it opens in the summer of 2025.\\nImagine a cutting-edge venue with the visual impact of a film festival, a museum\\'s sense of wonder and discovery, the multisensory bombardment of performance art and the intellectual challenge of an escape room — all wrapped up in a hyper-immersive story that reveals itself as you walk from room to room. That is Atlas9.\\nThe 46,000-square-foot, $26.7 million entertainment venue is being constructed as part of the Homefield project near 94th Street and State Avenue in Kansas City, Kansas. The project targets a grand opening next summer.\\nexpand\\nIt is the brainchild of Overland Park-based Dimensional Innovations, which built a reputation for creating unique and interesting building spaces and interactive exhibits ranging from the Kansas City Royals Hall of Fame to the Museum at Prairiefire to augmented-reality displays at American Century Investments\\' headquarters. The company teamed up with Swell Spark — operator of Blade & Timber ax-throwing facilities and Breakout KC — to operate Atlas9. Quixotic, the Kanas City-based performance art collective, will add its unique expertise to the project, as well.\\n\\'What we do is create remarkable experiences, and most of the time those are nonfiction stories,\\' Dimensional Innovations CEO Tucker Trotter said. \\'This is an opportunity to create something that\\'s completely based on fiction. We believe people need experiences now more than ever, and we get to create something where they\\'re going to be a part of the story. We don\\'t always get that much flexibility. It puts a tremendous amount of pressure on us, but it\\'s been really fun and fueled a lot of the passions and energy of our internal team. Everyone wants to work on this project because it\\'s so exciting.\\'\\nexpand\\nTrotter said Atlas 9 will draw from everything his organization learned since it was founded in 1993. It will pay homage to the company\\'s roots of helping AMC Theaters build interesting megaplexes and combine years of experience creating cutting-edge interactive exhibits for museums, children\\'s hospitals and professional sports venues.\\nThe company\\'s work, if not its name, has fans nationwide. Sports fans know it for projects like an updated Minnie & Paul Celebration sign and new 12-foot-diameter baseball-shaped sign at the Minnesota Twins\\' Target Field home or the newly iconic Al Davis Memorial Torch in Las Vegas\\' Allegiant Stadium. Children and parents have been positively distracted by decorations and interactive displays at children\\'s hospitals in Kansas City and Columbia and an immersive CreatureVerse at the Connecticut Children\\'s Medical Center. Tourists see the company\\'s handiwork in a life-sized dinosaur bursting out of the side of the Arizona Museum of Natural History and Malala exhibit at the Children\\'s Museum of Indianapolis.\\nHere\\'s a look at Dimensional Innovations\\' diverse portfolio of creations.\\nView Slideshow 13 photos\\nexpand\\nexpand\\nexpand\\nexpand\\nexpand\\nexpand\\nexpand\\nRandall Statler, creative director for Dimensional Innovations, leads the effort on Atlas9. His vision is to create a building full of rooms that each offer a unique experience. Guests can choose which direction to go, and their choices drive the overarching story thread.\\n\\'You\\'re basically walking through this and unpacking this narrative story in a nonlinear way,\\' Statler said. \\'If you take a left, you\\'re going to interpret and digest the narrative in a different way than the person who goes right.

All of us at Dimensional Innovations, Quixotic and Swell Spark are experience enthusiasts. This isn\\'t something that you go to, walk around, look at the art and say, \\'That\\'s cool.\\' It\\'s deeper and richer than that because you get to actually experience and interact with the artistic components themselves.\\'\\nexpand\\nBaysinger called Atlas9 one of the most rewarding projects he\\'s worked on in the past decade. He called the people working on it a \\'dream team\\' that considers all ideas, even if they seem impossible.\\n\\'It\\'s been really fun to realize what we are capable of, sometimes in a scary way,\\' Baysinger said. \\'Some of the ideas come out, and I\\'ll scratch my head because the logistics and complications of putting it together seem asinine, and I\\'m thinking there is no way to do it. Then Randall (Statler) comes back after the weekend and says his team figured it out and all the technology works. Quixotic is a big part of it, as well, and we get to work alongside some of the most incredible performers on Earth, who will be woven into the fabric of Atlas9, as well. Folks are going to come into this with expectations that it is small and realize as soon as they step through the door that what we\\'re doing here is big.\\'\\nThe goals for Atlas9 certainly aren\\'t small. It\\'s designers want it to be one of Kansas City\\'s top attractions, right up there with barbecue and the Kansas City Chiefs. They hope it becomes a must-see venue not only for people in the Kansas City area, but worldwide. It\\'s intentionally targeting an opening before Kansas City hosts matches for the 2026 World Cup to give it the best opportunity to make an impression in a global way.\\n\\'We want this to speak to the modernity of the local art scene,\\' Statler said. \\'Kansas City has already been on the trajectory of establishing artistic credibility on a regional and national stage. This is the right time and the right thing to reward that inertia and have it really pay off. It just feels natural and right.\\'\\n\\nSergey Lavrov believes fighting for victory with nuclear weapons is \"senseless\"\\nNone\\nSergey Lavrov said using nuclear weapons at all costs to win the war was \"senseless\".\\nRussia\\'s foreign minister launched a series of criticisms against the West during a speech to the United Nations on Saturday, also pointing out that Russia can use its nuclear arsenal in the event of a serious threat.\\nThe top diplomat argued that the West was using Ukraine as an excuse \"to defeat\" Moscow strategically.\\n\"I\\'m not going to talk here about the senselessness and the danger of the very idea of trying to fight to victory with a nuclear power, which is what Russia is,\" he said.\\nEarlier this week, Vladimir Putin hinted that he had lowered his conditions for deploying his nuclear arsenal in Ukraine as Kyiv seeks US approval to use their weapons directly on Russian soil.\\nThis week, Joe Biden announced that $2.7 billion in new military aid would be allocated to Ukraine, but this will not include long-range weapons, something Volodymyr Zelenskyy had been hopeful to obtain for months.\\nRussian nuclear warheads have been stored in Belarus since last year.\\n(QG - Source : Associated Press / Picture: © Pixabay)\\nBe sure to read all our articles on MSN by subscribing to our content.

After Pittsburgh\\'s last game, Harris was seen in the locker room with a sling over his arm. Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said there would be \"no limitations for Naj\" heading into Week 4. If he isn\\'t fully healthy, the Colts\\' defense needs to take advantage of playing against a worsened rushing attack. Backup running back Jaylen Warren will also miss the game for Pittsburgh, making it an ideal situation for a Colts run defense that had a bounce-back performance last week. On top of running back injuries, the Steelers will be without starting guard Isaac Seumalo. It\\'ll be backups against backups in the trenches on Sunday afternoon.\\nStop Drives in the Red Zone: The Steelers\\' offense has the worst red zone conversion rate in the league, only turning 25% of their trips into touchdowns. Living on field goals isn\\'t sustainable for any team, making it ultra-important that the Colts\\' defense kills drives before they turn into six points. The secondary will play a big part in this, especially when looking at the Pittsburgh receiving corps. George Pickens stands out as the main red zone threat, but no other Steelers receiver is listed as over 6-foot-1. If the Colts can clamp down on a smaller group of pass catchers, it would help take some weight off the expectations of Anthony Richardson and the Indianapolis offense.\\nForce Justin Fields to Throw it Deep: The Steelers are ranked in the bottom 10 of the league in yards per attempt, meaning short passes are the lifeblood of the offense. Forcing Justin Fields to make risky reads would help the Colts\\' defense a lot, especially if he is forced to aim it toward safety Julian Blackmon. In Gus Bradley\\'s defense, that may be a tough ask. Sitting in a zone means the quarterback prefers to find the empty space, which usually isn\\'t deep down the field. Changing up the scheme a little bit could help Colts defenders make big-time plays against a quarterback who\\'s only turned the ball over twice this season. Time of possession has not supported the Colts in the past, so small plays that add up could be poisonous for Indy. Forcing 50-50 balls is a necessity for the defense so they can stay off the field and keep the rock in Richardson\\'s hands.Retractable roof/window stadium (closed).

The Sooners were without five receivers and Taylor Tatum , while the defense was missing starting cheetah Kendel Dolby . That led to the Sooners playing several depth pieces on both sides of the ball.\\nAUBURN, Alabama — The Sooners somehow escaped with a 27-21 win over Auburn on Saturday, scoring 17 unanswered points to rally late and stun the Tigers.\\n1. Gavin Sawchuk... as the third-down running back?\\nWith Taylor Tatum unavailable, it was expected that Sawchuk would see an increase in snaps. He saw 19 snaps against Auburn, a significant uptick from the seven he saw against Tennessee.\\nHowever, he wasn\\'t really utilized as ball-carrier. The Sooners essentially utilized him as a third-down running back primarily tasked with pass blocking. 13 of his 19 snaps came on passing downs and he ran nine routes, though he wasn\\'t targeted. He\\'s also credited with seven snaps, though those likely came on scrambles from Michael Hawkins.\\nSawchuk only saw one carry and it was his best of the season, as he gashed Auburn for 16 yards. But the play was called back on a hold by Jake Roberts. Therefore, Sawchuk was not credited with any rushing attempts.\\nJovantae Barnes continues to operate as the Sooners\\' clear running back. He made his second consecutive start and played 37 snaps, recording all 18 of the running back carries. Even with Tatum out, the Sooners simply didn\\'t look for any other running backs to run the ball. Sam Franklin and Kalib Hicks never saw the field.\\nBarring any unexpected developments, it\\'s clear that the backfield belongs to Barnes and Tatum.\\n2. Woodi Washington\\'s snaps are going down\\nIf there\\'s been anything noticeable about the Sooners\\' cornerback room, it\\'s Washington. Specifically, his snaps are only going down. But the Sooners turned to Samuel Omosigho and Bowman to pick up the slack at cheetah.\\nHere are his snap counts over the last four weeks: 50, 46, 40, 34. His 34 snaps against Auburn were a season low, and that came despite Kendel Dolby and Gentry Williams both missing the game. He also didn\\'t start against the Tigers.\\nThe Sooners have been content to use Kani Walker and Dez Malone at cornerback, even as both have had their struggles. Both got burned for long touchdowns against the Tigers, though Malone had a significantly better grade than Walker. Eli Bowen did play 29 snaps, a slight uptick from the 23 he played against Tennessee.\\nIt just hasn\\'t been the best season for Washington thus far.\\n3. Bauer Sharp bounce-back game\\nSharp took full responsibility for his poor showing against Tennessee, where he struggled with blocking and had a costly drop.\\nAccording to the stats, it was a complete 180 for Sharp. He not only led the Sooners in receptions (4 for 43), but he had the highest performance grade on the offense by far. He also had a 70.0 pass-blocking grade a team-best 69.0 run-blocking grade.\\nThe rest of the tight end room was subpar. Jake Roberts accounted for two penalties and Kade McIntyre, who had the lowest PFF grade, had one. On the Sooners\\' first series of the fourth quarter, Roberts and McIntyre committed costly penalties on back-to-back plays that contributed to a turnover on downs. Neither of them caught a pass.\\n\\nSouthwest Airlines Unrecognizable From Former Identity\\nSouthwest has unveiled more changes and a new international partnership in its pivot from Low Cost Carrier to standard network airline.\\nMy dear readers, some links on this site pay us referral fees for sending business and sales.

Southwest Airlines Former Identity\\nIn 1990s, Southwest moved from a quiet little niche Texas airline to a national powerhouse. The Southwest Effect would lower fares in a new city as the airline expanded by an average of 15% and increased travelers through that airport by 28-30%. The no frills approach was an inferior offering to network carriers at the time who were still offering two checked bags, meals in coach even on short flights, and point-to-point service over congested hub and spoke models.\\nAs the market changed, mostly after September 11th, Southwest stayed the same. What once was a constant compromise for travelers using secondary airports (Manchester, New Hampshire instead of Boston Logan) and forgoing service onboard, became industry-leading with included luggage, one of the most widespread internet install bases, and a cancellation policy that has long allowed travelers to hold onto their value for a future trip.\\nThey were also less expensive, but that\\'s not been the case for more than a decade. Southwest and IcelandAir Partnership\\nSouthwest Airlines and IcelandAir announced a partnership that will take flight in 2025. It will allow Southwest flyers to book and redeem for flights to Europe and for European travelers to reach greater US destinations. Many of Southwest\\'s destinations are already served by IcelandAir in a meaningful way offering greater onward connections. Several of those 14 North American destinations are in focus cities for Southwest\\'s network such as Denver (DEN), Baltimore (BWI), Nashville (BNA), and Orlando (MCO.)\\nThis is not the first time that Southwest has joined forces with a foreign carrier. Southwest\\'s initial partner was when it codeshared with WestJet for some time before ending the airline partnership. It also sought a tie-up with Volaris in 2009 for onward service throughout Mexico.\\nIcelandAir may be different than the others because its customer base has changed. Now, the airline flies into major hubs it fought hard to avoid such as LaGuardia, Dallas/Fort Worth, and Chicago O\\'Hare. It serves more business flyers than ever before (though they are pulling back some now.) Seating Plan Fully Unveiled\\nIts signature \\'sit wherever you want\\' cattle call has been retired in favor assigned seating. This is, of course, to drive and segment revenue. Assigned seats with access to more space will coincide with more expensive fares, and in time with the ability to buy up just the better seat assignment. Premium seats for now are limited to more space in some coach seats while reducing space throughout the rest of the cabin.\\nWhen Southwest announced the assigned seating plan, some had believed it was solely to expedite seating, reward more frequent customers, or those flying on higher value fares. But it\\'s clear that\\'s not going to be the case.\\nThe airline has, for now, stated it will keep two free checked bags, but like everything else in the march toward improving shareholder value will be subject to investor approval.\\nAll of the moves that the carrier has made are standard network carrier moves because it\\'s facing standard network carrier problems. American, Delta, and United have 952, 947, and 924 aircraft respectively. Southwest comes in fourth at 814, a sizable fleet. For comparison, the next closest carrier is SkyWest (which serves the others on feeder flights) at just less than 500. Alaska comes in at 365 (426 with Hawaiian.) Southwest had 171 million enplaned passengers, ahead of United by 7 million in 2023.\\nJust as the other carriers have found value in segmenting passengers and ancillary revenue, so too is Southwest – the last hold out – joining the ranks. Who The Carrier Is Now, And What\\'s Next?\\nSouthwest is at a confusing juxtaposition. In order to continue to grow, it\\'s going to need to further segment, offer something below its mostly included model, and add further partnerships. The airline has few destinations in the United States for which it can continue to add meaningful seats and revenue. And as its customer base changes, so too will its partnerships. Past relationships were to serve near field markets on leisure routes. The future is going to be offering something more premium.\\nAlaska demonstrated a model of adding partners across alliances (before it joined oneworld) that helped its customers move around the world on airline partners like Air France, British Airways, and Emirates. While onward connections likely helped Emirates passengers get elsewhere in North America, redemptions were likely the reason that partnership devolved.\\nToday, some Southwest passengers want to go to Paris, London, or Rome and before the IcelandAir partnership, they have to choose other carriers for those destinations. This is the lowest hanging fruit, but is it enough? I\\'d argue that Southwest customers probably want to go deeper throughout the Caribbean than the handful of destinations the airline offers. Perhaps it\\'s helpful to look outside of airline relationships too like cruise lines, and hotel chains. Hyatt and American have found success in their relationship, Marriott and United have a deal, Delta and SPG pioneered this type of partnership. Maybe Southwest and Hilton will get together. Maybe something a little more unique like Sandals/Beaches resorts as Southwest flies to many of Sandals\\' resort destinations.\\nAs crazy as it sounds, Southwest may have to consider an alliance membership too. Southwest is large enough to become an anchor for a new alliance and there are likeminded carriers without an alliance that could help Southwest expand its wings, and for global carriers to gain access to more US destinations. Attractive global carriers like Emirates, Etihad, Starlux, and IcelandAir could help to build a broader footprint. As we\\'ve seen in recent years, some carriers like SAS, have switched from one to another, that too could happen.\\nWe can\\'t forget the comments that Southwest\\'s Boeing exposure has put the airline in a compromised situation. This could mean new airframes from Airbus. And while we are breaking the aircraft mold Southwest has occupied, we may also want to find some products better suited to its missions, including A220s for longer, narrow markets.\\nThe only thing we know for sure is that Southwest will have to continue to evolve in a way that it hasn\\'t before. It\\'s not the same Southwest it has been and probably shouldn\\'t be thought of as such.\\nWhat do you think?\\n\\nA prolonged dockworkers\\' strike could mean products miss peak holiday shopping season\\nA strike could shut down 36 ports from Maine to Texas that handle about half the goods shipped into and out of the United States.\\nWith a dockworkers\\' strike threatening to close ports on the East and Gulf coasts beginning this week, Chris Butler is growing worried.\\nButler is CEO of the National Tree Company, and, like many businesses, his is counting on shipments that are en route from Asia but won\\'t reach their ports before an expected strike by longshoremen starting at 12:01 a.m. Eastern time Tuesday.\\nThe company, based in New Jersey, is an importer of artificial Christmas trees and other holiday decorations. If a strike were to last just a few days, there might be time afterward to unload the trees, transport them to warehouses and have them ready for customers this season.\\nYet if a strike were to keep ports closed until, say, November, about 150,000 trees might not arrive in time for the peak shopping season, imposing costs on National Tree and other businesses. In a worst-case scenario, those costs, multiplied across industries, could fuel inflation and pressure the U.S. economy.\\n\\'Definitely not an ideal situation,\\' Butler said.\\nNational Tree already has stockpiled or delivered most of the roughly 2 million artificial trees it sells each year. But it would lose revenue if 150,000 of the trees got stuck in the pipeline.\\nOther businesses face the same predicament, with goods that could be stranded at sea if 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen\\'s Association make good on their threat to strike. They could shut down 36 ports from Maine to Texas that handle about half the goods shipped into and out of the United States. (West Coast dockworkers belong to a different union and aren\\'t involved in the strike.)\\nA prolonged strike would force companies to pay shippers for the delays, and goods could arrive too late for the high point of holiday shopping season. On Friday, top Biden administration officials met with port operators and told them they should negotiate with the union ahead of Tuesday, according to a White House official who insisted on anonymity to discuss an ongoing meeting.\\nButler says he\\'s hoping for an agreement or for government intervention to halt a strike. But the U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents shippers and ports, and the longshoremen\\'s union haven\\'t met since June. And no talks are scheduled.\\nThe union is demanding significantly higher wages and a total ban on the automation of cranes, gates and moving containers in the loading and unloading of freight.\\nThe Toy Association, the nation\\'s leading toy trade group, was among about 200 organizations that asked President Joe Biden in a letter this month to work with both sides to reach an agreement. The National Grain and Feed Association also urged Biden to take action to avert a strike, which would come just as harvest season gets underway.\\nTheir push has put Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, in a sensitive position: Both have courted union support and don\\'t want to be seen as pressuring the longshoremen to reach a settlement. Yet if an extended strike were to cause shortages of consumer goods or fuel high inflation, it could cost Harris votes in the November election.\\nUnder the Taft-Hartley Act, Biden could seek a court order to suspend the strike for an 80-day cooling-off period. Robyn Patterson, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement that the administration has never invoked the act and isn\\'t considering it now.\\nBiden and Congress did step in two years ago to block a looming freight rail strike and force those workers to accept a deal because of widespread fears that a rail strike would have damaged the economy.\\nAlex Hertel-Fernandez, an associate professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University who served as a Labor Department official under Biden, suggested that the administration will follow the playbook it used in talks last year between West Coast ports and the union there: Mediating negotiations without directly intervening.\\nGreg Ahearn, CEO of the Toy Association, said a strike would happen at a critical moment for toy sellers and makers: Up to 60% of annual sales occur from October through December. Though some toy companies shipped goods earlier, Ahearn said a strike would make it hard to replenish hot-selling items.\\nA strike, he warned, could raise toy prices \\'based on scarcity and increased costs.\\'\\nAt National Tree, Butler and his crew began preparing for a strike in July. They accelerated shipments for everything they could. But one major retail client, he said, asked for trees early. And until recently, factories in China and elsewhere couldn\\'t produce the rest of National Tree\\'s orders.\\nShips containing the trees are on the way to New York but won\\'t get there before Tuesday. A prolonged strike, Butler said, would force most of the trees to be warehoused until next Christmas season.\\nA longshoremen\\'s strike would further distress a global supply chain that has already endured slowdowns from attacks by Yemen\\'s Houthi rebels on commercial shipping. Those attacks have all but shut down the use of the Red Sea and Suez Canal, said Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation. The attacks are forcing longer transit times for vessels that must navigate around the Cape of Good Hope to reach East Coast and Gulf Coast ports.\\nA dockworkers\\' strike, Gold said, could prove even more damaging than the pandemic-induced port congestion in 2021 and 2022, when cargo was allowed to move, albeit slowly.\\nEastern ports could be left at a standstill. Gold noted that carriers are already announcing surcharges on containers to address potential disruptions, a trend that could elevate inflation.\\nMany retailers might find it difficult to charge customers more to make up for those expenses. Most vulnerable, Gold said, would be small businesses that don\\'t import directly and lack the financial resources to incur higher costs.\\nShippers could reroute some cargo to West Coast ports. But those ports couldn\\'t come close to absorbing the additional cargo. The Port of Los Angeles, for example, moved 960,000 containers in August — about 80% of its capacity — said Gene Seroka, its executive director.\\nThe major Western railroads, Union Pacific and BNSF, have added capacity to their systems to handle more freight as imports have increased. Eastern railroads CSX and Norfolk Southern say they can move cars and crews to handle more freight coming to Chicago from the West.

He also made arrangements with alternative suppliers in case the strike goes on indefinitely.

He just suffered massive financial losses thanks to selling his Malibu mansion. Kanye has been trying to sell the mansion for a while, and he just took a substantial loss on it with the amount he sold it for.\\nHere is what Kanye sold his mansion for and how much money he lost on the deal. Kanye Loses Millions By Selling Malibu Mansion\\nKanye West finally sold his Malibu mansion. However, if he thought he could make money off the sale, he was very wrong. Not only did he not make money, but he lost a great deal with the total that he finally got for the house. YouTube/Jimmy Kimmel Live\\nKanye had to drop the price he was asking by almost $15 million when no one made an offer to buy it from him. The biggest problem is there are a lot of problems with the mansion, which is considered to be \\'crumbling.\\' When Kanye bought the mansion in 2021, he paid $57.3 million.\\nAfter he purchased the mansion, he gutted and abandoned it. Kanye later listed it for sale in December 2023. Since then, it has been sitting in escrow. Kanye initially listed the home for $53 million, trying to sell it for a little less than he paid. No one wanted it for that price.\\nFinally, in April, Kanye dropped the asking price to $39 million. According to Jason Oppenheim of the Oppenheim Group, whoever buys it will have to replace all the interior finishes, with Kanye gutted. That will cost millions (via The Hollywood Reporter ). \\'On the positive, it can be brought up to 2024 standards — it was built about 10 years ago,\\' he said. Kanye West Faced Lawsuits Based On The Mansion\\nKanye West also faced several legal problems concerning the mansion. The person he hired to gut it sued him for unpaid fees. Contractor Tony Saxon claimed Kanye owed him more than $1 million for his work. Kanye denied the claims in the lawsuit. Kanye West-YouTube\\nIn January, Ron Zambrano, a partner at West Coast Employment Lawyers, filed a mechanics lien on the property on behalf of Saxon. They claimed he owed them more than $1 million and wanted to ensure he had the money to pay them back \\'before he goes completely broke.\\' They said anyone who wanted to buy the mansion would have to go through them first to ensure they were paid.\\nWhile the interiors were gutted, the mansion\\'s exterior is still in great shape, thanks to its concrete work. It is a 4,000-square-foot house with 1,500 square feet of exterior decks, all with Pacific Ocean views.\\nAre you surprised at how much Kanye West lost in the selling of his Malibu mansion?

Airport Wi-Fi, in particular, is known to be a hacker honeypot, due to what is typically relatively lax security. But even though many people know they should stay away from free Wi-Fi, it proves as irresistible to travelers as it is to hackers, who are now updating an old cybercrime tactic to take advantage.\\nAn arrest in Australia over the summer set off alarm bells in the United States that cybercriminals are finding new ways to profit from what are called \"evil twin\" attacks. Also classified within a type of cybercrime called \"Man in the Middle\" attacks, evil twinning occurs when a hacker or hacking group sets up a fake Wi-Fi network, most often in public settings where many users can be expected to connect.\\nIn this instance, an Australian man was charged with conducting a Wi-Fi attack on domestic flights and airports in Perth, Melbourne, and Adelaide. He allegedly set up a fake Wi-Fi network to steal email or social media credentials.\\n\"As the general population becomes more accustomed to free Wi-Fi everywhere, you can expect evil twinning attacks to become more common,\" said Matt Radolec, vice president of incident response and cloud operations at data security firm Varonis, adding that no one reads the terms and conditions or checks the URLs on free Wi-Fi.\\n\"It\\'s almost a game to see how fast you can click \"accept\" and then \\'sign in\\' or \\'connect.\\' This is the ploy, especially when visiting a new location; a user might not even know what a legitimate site should look like when presented with a fake site,\" Radolec said.\\nOne of the dangers of today\\'s twinning attacks is that the technology is much easier to disguise. An evil twin can be a tiny device and can be tucked behind a display in a coffee shop, and the small device can have a significant impact.\\n\"A device like this can serve up a compelling copy of a valid login page, which could invite unwary device users to enter their username and password, which would then be collected for future exploitation,\" said Cincinnati-based IT consultant Brian Alcorn.\\nThe site doesn\\'t even have to actually log you in. \"Once you\\'ve entered your information, the deed is done,\" Alcorn said, adding that a harried, weary traveler probably would just think the airport Wi-Fi is having issues and not give it another thought.\\nPeople who are not careful with passwords, such as use of pet\\'s names or favorite sports teams as their password for everything, are even more vulnerable to an evil twin attack. Alcorn says for individuals who reuse username and password combinations online, once the credentials are obtained they can be fed into AI, where its power can quickly give cybercriminals the key.\\n\"You are susceptible to exploitation by someone with less than $500 in equipment and less skill than you might imagine,\" Alcorn said. \"The attacker just has to be motivated with basic IT skills.\"\\nWhen in public places, experts say it\\'s best to use alternatives to public WiFi networks.\\n\"My favorite way to avoid evil twin attacks is to use your phone\\'s mobile hotspot if possible,\" said Brian Callahan, Director of the Rensselaer Cybersecurity Collaboratory at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.\\nUsers would be able to spot an attack if through a phone relying on its mobile data and sharing it via a mobile hotspot.\\n\"You will know the name of that network since you made it, and you can put a strong password that only you know on it to connect,\" Callahan said.\\nIf a hotspot isn\\'t an option, a VPN can also provide some protection, Callahan said, as traffic should be encrypted to and from the VPN.\\n\"So even if someone else can see the data, they can\\'t do anything about it,\" he said.\\nAt many airports, the responsibility for WiFi is outsourced and the airport itself has little if any involvement in safeguarding it. At Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, for example, Boingo is the Wi-Fi provider.\\n\"The airport\\'s IT team does not have access to their systems, nor can we see usage and dashboards,\" For said an airport spokesman. \"The network is isolated from DAL\\'s systems as it is a separate standalone system with no direct connection to any of the City of Dallas\\' networks or systems internally.\"\\nA spokeswoman for Boingo, which provides service to approximately 60 airports in North America, said it can identify rogue Wi-Fi access points through its network management. \"The best way passengers can be protected is by using Passpoint, which uses encryption to automatically connect users to authenticated Wi-Fi for a safe online experience,\" she said, adding that Boingo has offered Passpoint since 2012 to enhance Wi-Fi security and eliminate the risk of connecting to malicious hotspots.\\nAlcorn says evil twin attacks are \"definitely\" occurring with regularity in the United States, it\\'s just rare for someone to get caught because they are such stealth attacks. And sometimes hackers use these attacks as a learning model. \"Many evil twin attacks may be experimental by individuals with novice-to-intermediate skills just to see if they can do it and get away with it, even if they don\\'t use the collected information right away,\" he said.\\nThe surprise in Australia wasn\\'t the evil twinning attack itself, but the arrest.\\n\"This incident isn\\'t unique, but it is unusual that the suspect was arrested,\" said Aaron Walton, threat analyst at Expel, a managed services security company. \"Generally, airlines are not equipped and prepared to handle or mediate hacking accusations. The typical lack of arrests and punitive action should motivate travelers to exercise caution with their own data, knowing what a tempting and usually unguarded -target it is — especially at the airport.\"\\nIn the Australian case, according to Australian Federal Police, dozens of people had their credentials stolen.\\nAccording to a press release from the AFP, \"When people tried to connect their devices to the free WiFi networks, they were taken to a fake webpage requiring them to sign in using their email or social media logins. Those details were then allegedly saved to the man\\'s devices.\"\\nOnce those credentials were harvested, they could be used to extract more information from the victims, including bank account information.\\nFor hackers to be successful, they don\\'t have to dupe everyone. If they can persuade only a handful of people – statistically easy to do when thousands of harried and hurried people are milling around an airport – they will succeed.\\n\"We expect WI-Fi to be everywhere. When you go to a hotel, or an airport, or a coffee shop, or even just out and about, we expect there to be Wi-Fi and often freely available WI-FI,\" Callahan said. \"After all, what\\'s yet another network name in the long list when you\\'re at an airport? An attacker doesn\\'t need everyone to connect to their evil twin, only some people who go on to put credentials into websites that can be stolen.\"\\nThe next time you\\'re at the airport, the only way to be 100% sure you\\'re safe is to bring your own Wi-Fi.\\n\\nPope Francis suggests Israel\\'s actions in Gaza and Lebanon are disproportionate and immoral\\nNone\\nPope Francis suggested Sunday that Israel\\'s attacks in Gaza and Lebanon have been \\'immoral\\' and disproportionate, saying its military domination has gone beyond the rules of war.\\nFrancis was asked en route home from Belgium about Israel\\'s targeted killing of one of Hezbollah\\'s founding members, Hassan Nasrallah. Friday\\'s strike in Beirut targeted an area greater than a city block and reduced several residential buildings to rubble, and at least six other deaths have been confirmed.\\nFrancis didn\\'t mention Israel by name and said he was speaking in general terms. But he said that \\'the defense must always be proportionate to the attack.\\'\\n\\'When there is something disproportionate, there is a dominating tendency that goes beyond morality,\\' he said. \\'A country that does these things — and I\\'m talking about any country — in a superlative way, these are immoral actions.\\'\\nHe said that even if war itself is immoral, there are rules that \\'indicate some morality.\\'\\n\\'But when you don\\'t do this … you see the bad blood of these things,\\' he said.\\nThe death of Nasrallah has sent shockwaves throughout Lebanon and the Middle East, where he has been a dominant political and military figure for more than three decades.\\nU.S. President Joe Biden said the Israeli strike was a \\'measure of justice\\' for victims of Hezbollah\\'s \\'reign of terror.\\'\\nFrancis has tried to strike a balance in his comments on the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel and the conflicts in Gaza and southern Lebanon that have ensued. He has called for an immediate cease-fire, for the release of hostages taken by Hamas and for humanitarian aid to get to Gaza.\\nFrancis repeated that he calls the Catholic parish in Gaza every day to see how they are doing.\\n___\\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP\\'s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Tom Cruise pulled another all-star stunt over the weekend, making a surprise appearance at a screening of Top Gun: Maverick . As if that wasn\\'t cool enough, the showing itself was backed by a live orchestra performing the movie\\'s score.\\nWith nearly 3,000 people in attendance, Tom Cruise\\'s surprise spot was an insanely huge hit within the famed Royal Albert Hall in London. During his introduction, Cruise expressed excitement at the rarity and history that the live music added to Top Gun: Maverick , noting its usage during the silent era.\\nWhile live musical accompaniments to modern films (that\\'s talkies, ya see) have become more popular over the years and it\\'s not uncommon to find them during special occasions (many theaters, for example, do Harry Potter films around Christmas), Cruise said that this particular screening of the Top Gun sequel would allow him to fulfill a lifelong desire. \\'I\\'ve always wanted to experience a film like this with a live full symphony orchestra, synchronized picture, in front of a packed audience in the grandeur of a classic movie palace. Thank you all for being here, and thank you for making this dream come true.\\' He even sat at the theater\\'s pipe organ, no doubt taking cues from his old pal Nick Nightingale.\\nCruise, ever the champion of cinema, also expressed his thanks to those behind the scenes of Top Gun: Maverick – both the film and the special screening. \\'The power of music and its use in cinema to deepen our experience of the story and our connection to the characters is absolutely magical.

Welcome to the 75th edition of your Sunday sports-potpourri notes column, the HB10:\\n1. DOLPHINS: Miami tabs Snoop as top Dogg for Monday night: Quarterback Tyler (Snoop) Huntley will be behind center Monday night as the Dolphins host Tennessee, replacing injured starter Tua Tagovailoa and injured backup Skylar Thompson. The 1-2 Fins have nudged up as from a 1- to a 2-point favorite against the winless Titans. Miami lucks to face a winnable four-game schedule stretch with the Patriots, Colts and Cardinals to follow.\\n2. HURRICANES: Lucky, last-second win in ACC opener the reality check UM needed: No. 7 Miami is a 5-0 team lucky to not be 4-1 after Friday night\\'s 38-34 home escape vs. Virginia Tech in the ACC opener. Official ruled Tech scored the winning pass on a Hail Mary as time expired but the call was controversially overturned on review. Canes had outscored their first four opponents 207-41, and I\\'d put Friday\\'s scare in the beneficial wakeup call/reality check category with challenging road trips to Cal and then No. 15 Louisville on deck.\\n3. MARLINS: Fish flush season today; Skip out; MLB playoffs on deck: The fire-sale Fish flush another sad season down the commode today at 61-100 entering the finale in Toronto. Miami manager Skip Schumaker is out as expected in a mutual parting. MLB postseason finds Shohei Ohtani\\'s Dodgers the betting fave to win the World Series followed by the Yankees and Phillies. Playoffs open with four wild-card games Tuesday -- with the NL\\'s Braves, Mets and Diamondbacks fighting down to the dramatic last day for the final two WC spots.\\n4. INTER MIAMI: Messi scores for draw; team can clinch Supporters Shield Wednesday: Lionel Messi\\'s goal in the 67th minute Saturday forged a 1-1 home draw with Charlotte and enabled Inter Miami on Wednesday at Columbus to clinch the MLS Supporters Shield for best season record in the league. Miami then finishes at Toronto and home vs. New England before the playoffs begins. Herons are healthy betting favorites to win the franchise\\'s first MLS Cup championship.\\n5. WNBA: Caitlin Clark eliminated; playoffs decide to go on anyway: Rookie sensation Clark\\'s Indiana Fever were eliminated 2-0 in the playoffs\\' first round as America mourned -- but the postseason, though diminished, bravely carries anyway. It\\'s New York Liberty vs. two-time defending champ Las Vegas Aces and Minnesota Lynx vs. Connecticut Sun in the conference finals starting today/Sunday. As for the Caitlin Effect: WNBA enjoyed its best attendance in 22 years, sellouts were up 242 percent, TV viewership was the best in 24 years, and merch sales spiked by 601%.\\n6. PANTHERS: Stanley Cup champ Cats nine days from NHL opener: The Panthers are 3-2 in the preseason after Saturday\\'s win vs. Carolina, with three practice games left starting Monday vs. Tampa. The champs begin defense of their Stanley Cup for real in nine days, October 8 at home vs. Boston -- the polar opposite of a soft opening. Cats eliminated the Bruins 4-2 in the second round of the \\'24 playoffs in the most physical test of the postseason.\\n7. TENNIS: Billie Jean King awarded major U.S. honor: For her career on the court and perhaps more so off it, Billie Jean King has received the Congressional Gold Medal -- the first individual woman athlete so honored. President Joe Biden signed the legislation recognizing King\\'s groundbreaking contributions. Now 80, King won 12 Grand Slam single titles and also blazed trails in gender equality, equal pay and women\\'s and LGBTQ rights. A big life well led -- and thankfully still going.\\n8. HEAT: As preseason nears, shade on Miami\\'s new alternate jersey: Every NBA team will introduce new \\'City Edition\\' alternate jerseys this season. The website SB Nation ranked them and the Miami Heat\\'s CE threads are one of five teams graded last in the F-tier with Heat listed at the very bottom. It\\'s a red, sleeveless jersey with \\'Heat\\' in small letters below \\'CULTURE\\' in bigger script. I don\\'t hate it but it is an extra heavy lean on the whole Heat Culture thing, which drives some folks nuts. (Team stages its media day Monday ahead of its preseason opener October 8.)\\n9. GOLF: Company benefiting from Tiger\\'s name sues Tiger in trademark dispute: A company that sells helmet-cooling products for athletes called Tigeraire is suing Tiger Woods\\' apparel brand Sun Day Red in a trademark dispute, claiming the brand \\'unlawfully hijacked\\' its logo design. (Both designs show a silhouette of a tiger.) Sports word association with the word \\'tiger\\' = Tiger Woods. Dear Tigeraire: Who\\'s ripping off who?\\n10. OLYMPICS: The value of a gold medal to one man in Hungary: Hungarian fencer László Csongrádi won gold in men\\'s team sabre at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. This month, his prize was stolen when his home was broken into as he slept. Now 65, Csongrádi so badly wants his medal back he has offered, upon his death, to leave it in his will to the thief who stole it if it is returned. \\'I want him to return the object that means nothing to him,\\' he said. The medal would be returned with no such macabre strings attached, if only there was honor among thieves.\\nNEW HB10 FEATURE: THE LIST: \\'The List\\' will bring you something unexpected every Sunday.

The direct routes were originally announced as year-round flights, according to previous Business Journal reports. But both have seemingly switched to seasonal routes, with Aer Lingus and Delta stopping the direct flights by the end of this month, according to flight schedules.\\nAer Lingus\\' 2024 MSP to Dublin route has been using a widebody A330-200 airplane, which has a two-class configuration of 23 business class and 248 economy class seats. For 2025, the carrier plans to fly the route on a narrowbody Airbus A321XLR with 16 business class and 168 economy cabin seats.\\nAccording to an X post by Thrifty Traveler editor Kyle Potter, Aer Lingus will also increase the frequency of flights.\\nDelta will also continue its direct flight to Dublin, Potter said. Delta\\'s Minneapolis-Dublin flight will continue to operate on a widebody Boeing 767-300 with 28 Delta One seats, 18 Premium Select seats, 21 Comfort Plus seats and 151 economy seats.\\nAer Lingus\\'s flight will resume April 5, 2025, and increase its flights from four times a week to seven times a week. The Irish carrier will also resume its direct flights from Denver, increasing its frequency to six times weekly.\\nThe announcements follow Delta\\'s recent revival of its direct flight to Rome from MSP in the summer of 2025. The Atlanta-based carrier announced it would add four weekly flights from MSP, its second-largest hub, to Rome from late May through late October. Delta briefly flew an MSP-to-Rome direct route in 2016, though it only lasted one summer.\\nDelta could also bring more European routes to MSP in the future.\\nDelta CEO Ed Bastian noted at the Airport Foundation MSP\\'s State of the Airport Event this week that a direct route to Scandinavia could come soon. The Atlanta-based carrier has built a closer relationship with Scandinavian Airlines (known as SAS) after the Copenhagen-based airline switched to the same airline alliance as Delta.\\nJust this week, the two airlines signed a code-sharing agreement effective Sept. 25. The agreement allows Delta customers flying from North America to gain additional access to 50 destinations in Northern Europe beyond SAS\\'s hubs in Copenhagen, Oslo and Stockholm. SAS customers will gain access to more than 150 destinations in North America via Delta\\'s hubs in Atlanta, Boston, Los Angeles, New York and Seattle.\\n\\nOp-ed: Just like the rest of the nation, America\\'s small businesses are at a crossroads\\nAs the presidential election nears, small business owners are cautiously optimistic, despite cost concerns, a CNBC|SurveyMonkey study finds.\\nCNBC and SurveyMonkey\\'s latest quarterly polling of America\\'s small business owners finds a mixed economic outlook, with optimism generated by rate cuts to spur additional spending but concerns about inflation and costs lingering.\\nLast week, the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates for the first time in over four years, signaling a potential uplift for stocks and Wall Street. But what does it mean for the backbone of America, our small businesses?\\nA new CNBC|SurveyMonkey study fielded just before the Fed announced its first rate cut, which was anticipated — though the exact size of the cut was not — offers a glimpse into the minds of these entrepreneurs. The quarterly snapshot of Main Street businesses reveals a mixed bag of cautious optimism alongside lingering concerns about inflation and rising costs. With a divisive presidential election on the horizon, the uncertainty is palpable.\\nFour in ten (38%) agreed that inflation continues to be the biggest risk to their business. This is nearly three times higher than the next highest risks, consumer demand (13%) and interest rates (10%).\\nNonetheless, the anticipated interest rate cuts also sparked a surge in confidence. A third (33%) of respondents believed that inflation had peaked, and overall optimism for inflation relief is the highest since the first quarter of this year.\\nThree in five (62%) small business owners expected some degree of impact on the business from the recent interest rate cuts, with 22% expecting a major impact, and 41% a minor impact. These cuts are fueling action among small business owners: 40% intended to increase investments, 37% planned to expand their business, and 26% said they would stock up on inventory. Only one in five planned on increasing employee wages or benefits (20%) or hiring more employees (17%).\\nKickstarted by the Fed\\'s recent decision, there is evident hope for stability as the economy seems poised to take a big step in a positive direction. For borrowers eager to take advantage of cheaper borrowing costs, this move could provide the boost they have been waiting for.\\nAhead of November, business leaders on both sides of the political spectrum are largely voting along party lines, with Democrats and Republicans sticking to their party choices.\\nHowever, one interesting divide emerged in the survey. Republican small business owners preferred Joe Biden to Kamala Harris. Half of Republican small business owners (53%) favored Biden over Harris as the Democratic candidate, potentially showing a divide in how different candidates\\' economic policies resonate with Main Street — or possibly an expectation that Biden would be easier for Trump to defeat in the election.\\nMeanwhile, Democratic business owners overwhelmingly stand behind Harris. Nine in ten (90%) of these owners support Harris as the Democrat candidate, revealing the stark political polarization that exists in this community.\\nOur study revealed a notable lack of enthusiasm for vice presidential candidates Tim Walz and JD Vance on both sides of the political aisle.\\nNearly four in ten (37%) small business owners thought that Vance would have a positive impact on their business, 13 points lower than Donald Trump (50%) but still higher than the Democratic vice presidential pick Walz (29%). Although both candidates saw majority support among small business owners from their respective parties (68% for Vance among Republican small business owners, and 67% for Walz among Democrat small business owners), presidential candidates generated stronger support within their respective parties (89% for Trump and 79% for Harris).\\nThe CNBC|SurveyMonkey study affirms that businesses are cautiously optimistic as they continue to navigate the crosswinds of this uncertain landscape. While interest rate cuts are driving optimism and owners plan to reinvest their business in various ways, it will be imperative to continue to monitor and analyze this group as election season heats up.\\n— By Eric Johnson, CEO, SurveyMonkey\\n\\nOp-ed: Just like the rest of the nation, America\\'s small businesses are at a crossroads\\nAs the presidential election nears, small business owners are cautiously optimistic, despite cost concerns, a CNBC|SurveyMonkey study finds.\\nLast week, the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates for the first time in over four years, signaling a potential uplift for stocks and Wall Street.

A third (33%) of respondents believed that inflation had peaked, and overall optimism for inflation relief is the highest since the first quarter of this year.\\nThree in five (62%) small business owners expected some degree of impact on the business from the recent interest rate cuts, with 22% expecting a major impact, and 41% a minor impact. These cuts are fueling action among small business owners: 40% intended to increase investments, 37% planned to expand their business, and 26% said they would stock up on inventory. Only one in five planned on increasing employee wages or benefits (20%) or hiring more employees (17%).\\nKickstarted by the Fed\\'s recent decision, there is evident hope for stability as the economy seems poised to take a big step in a positive direction. For borrowers eager to take advantage of cheaper borrowing costs, this move could provide the boost they have been waiting for.\\nAhead of November, business leaders on both sides of the political spectrum are largely voting along party lines, with Democrats and Republicans sticking to their party choices.\\nHowever, one interesting divide emerged in the survey. Republican small business owners preferred Joe Biden to Kamala Harris. Half of Republican small business owners (53%) favored Biden over Harris as the Democratic candidate, potentially showing a divide in how different candidates\\' economic policies resonate with Main Street — or possibly an expectation that Biden would be easier for Trump to defeat in the election.\\nMeanwhile, Democratic business owners overwhelmingly stand behind Harris. Nine in ten (90%) of these owners support Harris as the Democrat candidate, revealing the stark political polarization that exists in this community.\\nOur study revealed a notable lack of enthusiasm for vice presidential candidates Tim Walz and JD Vance on both sides of the political aisle.\\nNearly four in ten (37%) small business owners thought that Vance would have a positive impact on their business, 13 points lower than Donald Trump (50%) but still higher than the Democratic vice presidential pick Walz (29%). Although both candidates saw majority support among small business owners from their respective parties (68% for Vance among Republican small business owners, and 67% for Walz among Democrat small business owners), presidential candidates generated stronger support within their respective parties (89% for Trump and 79% for Harris).\\nThe CNBC|SurveyMonkey study affirms that businesses are cautiously optimistic as they continue to navigate the crosswinds of this uncertain landscape. While interest rate cuts are driving optimism and owners plan to reinvest their business in various ways, it will be imperative to continue to monitor and analyze this group as election season heats up.\\n\\nHaryana BJP Expels 8 Members Including Former Minister For Contesting Assembly Polls Independently\\nNone\\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) in Haryana expelled its eight members for six years from the party for contesting the upcoming state assembly elections independently after they were denied party tickets.

It\\'s the ‘golden egg\\' savings vehicle for young people\\nEstablishing a Roth IRA for kids can set them on the path to financial security. By starting early, they can take advantage of the benefits of tax-free growth.\\nAs a financial advisor mom of three kids, I know well the power of compounded interest and the value of early work experience and learning to save and invest for yourself.\\nMy kids — ages 15, 12 and 11 — have been tutoring, filing, shredding, sweeping, and even researching and creating infographics for friends and our own companies for a while.\\nThis has not only helped them develop responsible work habits and meet deadlines around their usual school work and extracurricular activities, but it also gives them hands-on experience managing an income. It teaches them at an early age the value of saving for the future and prioritizing important goals such as retirement.\\nFor kids, that seems like eons away. But getting started early can offer tremendous advantages. Then, you might be wondering — like many of my clients do — what\\'s the best way to save for our kids?\\nI believe the answer is for them to save in their very own Roth individual retirement accounts.\\nYes, kids can have their own Roth IRA — and, just like for adults, the IRS rules are pretty straightforward.\\nFor 2024, the total contribution an individual under age 50 can make to any IRA account — whether Roth, traditional or some combination of the two — is $7,000. If someone\\'s earned income is less than that, they can contribute only up to the amount of income that they earned — no \"gift money.\"\\nWhile the child needs to have earned income to qualify for contributions, the money used to fund the Roth IRA can be contributed from someone else. This means the child can keep their earnings for immediate spending, while the Roth IRA is funded separately, helping them build a financial foundation without dipping into their own pockets.\\nParents, grandparents or any generous relative or benefactor can set up a Roth IRA for a child.\\nThere\\'s no minimum age requirement for contributing to a Roth IRA; if a child can earn money, they can have a Roth IRA.\\nBut if the child is a minor — under age 18 in most states but under age 21 in some — a parent or guardian must open a custodial Roth IRA in the child\\'s name and manage the investments until the child reaches the age of majority. Although the custodian makes decisions on the account, the child is the beneficial owner, meaning the funds must be used for their benefit.\\nMore about those income requirements: To contribute to a Roth IRA, the child must have earned income. This income could come from traditional employment, such as a part-time job, or from self-employment activities such as babysitting or lawn mowing. Money received from parents for chores or as an allowance does not count, nor do cash gifts.\\nMost kids, at least the younger ones, are unlikely to earn the $7,000 maximum allowable annual contribution for 2024 and are limited to the total amount they earned during the year.\\nEven if the child is not required to file an income tax return, the parent or other custodian must still keep careful records of the earnings that are used to contribute to the Roth. Self-employment income might be subject to additional taxes such as Medicare and Social Security. It\\'s wise to consult a tax professional to ensure compliance and maximize benefits.\\nI think of the Roth IRA as the \"golden egg\" savings vehicle for young people because not only is the account tax-sheltered, it also has the beneﬁt of liquidity.\\nA Roth can be treated like the long-term savings vehicle it is designed to be, but in case of an emergency, since kids have decades ahead of them before retirement, there are ways to access the contributions without penalties or other drawbacks.\\nEstablishing a Roth IRA for youngsters is a powerful way to set them on the path to financial security. By starting early, they can take full advantage of the benefits of tax-free growth, potentially amassing a significant retirement fund by the time they reach retirement age.\\nThere are other advantages as well. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so withdrawals during retirement can be tax-free, provided certain conditions are met. This is particularly advantageous for children, who are likely in a low or zero tax bracket now, which allows them to grow their investments without the burden of taxes.\\nIn addition, starting early allows the account to benefit from decades of compound interest, significantly growing the balance over time. For instance, if a 15-year-old contributes $2,000 annually until age 65, with an average annual return of 7%, the account could grow to nearly $1 million.\\nUnlike traditional IRAs, contributions to a Roth can be withdrawn at any time without penalties or taxes, and under certain circumstances, even earnings can be withdrawn without penalties for a first-time home purchase, for example.\\nAs another benefit, unlike traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs do not require withdrawals at a certain age, allowing the account to continue growing tax-free for as long as the owner chooses. This gives young people more control over their retirement funds and can be advantageous in managing their retirement income.\\nFurthermore, starting a Roth IRA can help young people learn about investing, saving and financial planning from an early age. The structure of a Roth IRA encourages a long-term outlook on finances, helping young people build a secure financial future.\\n\\nThe No. 1 misconception most people have about feeling rich—and how to combat it, from a financial psychologist\\nUnless you change your mindset about wealth, you may feel like enough is never enough, says financial psychologist Charles Chaffin.\\nMany Americans believe they need to earn a certain dollar amount to feel rich.\\nBut even if they hit that goal or surpass it, they may be disappointed to find out they still don\\'t feel satisfied with their finances, says Charles Chaffin, co-founder of the Financial Psychology Institute and a professor at Iowa State University.\\n\"The misconception is that there\\'s an actual number and when people hit that number, they\\'ll suddenly feel wealthy,\" he tells CNBC Make It. \"Wealth is a subjective experience and is more than just how much money you have.\"\\nIn fact, even millionaires don\\'t always feel well off financially, according to recent data from Northwestern Mutual\\'s 2024 Planning & Progress study.

But getting started early can offer tremendous advantages. Then, you might be wondering — like many of my clients do — what\\'s the best way to save for our kids?\\nI believe the answer is for them to save in their very own Roth individual retirement accounts.\\nYes, kids can have their own Roth IRA — and, just like for adults, the IRS rules are pretty straightforward.\\nFor 2024, the total contribution an individual under age 50 can make to any IRA account — whether Roth, traditional or some combination of the two — is $7,000. If someone\\'s earned income is less than that, they can contribute only up to the amount of income that they earned — no \"gift money.\"\\nWhile the child needs to have earned income to qualify for contributions, the money used to fund the Roth IRA can be contributed from someone else.

Although the custodian makes decisions on the account, the child is the beneficial owner, meaning the funds must be used for their benefit.\\nMore about those income requirements: To contribute to a Roth IRA, the child must have earned income. This income could come from traditional employment, such as a part-time job, or from self-employment activities such as babysitting or lawn mowing. Money received from parents for chores or as an allowance does not count, nor do cash gifts.\\nMost kids, at least the younger ones, are unlikely to earn the $7,000 maximum allowable annual contribution for 2024 and are limited to the total amount they earned during the year.\\nEven if the child is not required to file an income tax return, the parent or other custodian must still keep careful records of the earnings that are used to contribute to the Roth. Self-employment income might be subject to additional taxes such as Medicare and Social Security. It\\'s wise to consult a tax professional to ensure compliance and maximize benefits.\\nI think of the Roth IRA as the \"golden egg\" savings vehicle for young people because not only is the account tax-sheltered, it also has the beneﬁt of liquidity.\\nA Roth can be treated like the long-term savings vehicle it is designed to be, but in case of an emergency, since kids have decades ahead of them before retirement, there are ways to access the contributions without penalties or other drawbacks.\\nEstablishing a Roth IRA for youngsters is a powerful way to set them on the path to financial security. By starting early, they can take full advantage of the benefits of tax-free growth, potentially amassing a significant retirement fund by the time they reach retirement age.\\nThere are other advantages as well. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so withdrawals during retirement can be tax-free, provided certain conditions are met. This is particularly advantageous for children, who are likely in a low or zero tax bracket now, which allows them to grow their investments without the burden of taxes.\\nIn addition, starting early allows the account to benefit from decades of compound interest, significantly growing the balance over time. For instance, if a 15-year-old contributes $2,000 annually until age 65, with an average annual return of 7%, the account could grow to nearly $1 million.\\nUnlike traditional IRAs, contributions to a Roth can be withdrawn at any time without penalties or taxes, and under certain circumstances, even earnings can be withdrawn without penalties for a first-time home purchase, for example.\\nAs another benefit, unlike traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs do not require withdrawals at a certain age, allowing the account to continue growing tax-free for as long as the owner chooses.

Users on Telegram reported hearing explosions near a Russian Navy airfield in Eisk and Krasnodar Krai, according to Digi24.\\nUkrainian forces specifically targeted energy and military installations deemed strategically significant in several regions, including Volgograd, Tambov, Oryol, Lipetsk, Tula, Saratov, Kuban, and Stavropol.\\nAlso read\\nUkrainians Launch MiG-29 Strikes on Russian Stronghold Disguised as Museum\\nFurther explosions were reported in Tsimlyansk, part of Rostov region, where the regional governor stated that air defense forces managed to intercept and destroy four drones over the Azov region.\\nIn Voronezh, downed drones reportedly caused fires, and local residents reported hearing at least ten explosions.\\nThe governor of Rostov announced that a total of 18 drones had been shot down within the region, indicating the intensity of the assault.\\nThis offensive comes as Ukraine continues to defend itself against a large-scale Russian invasion that has persisted for over two and a half years.

The IPL teams, using a combination of retention and Right-To-Match option, can retain up to six players from their 2024 squad - comprising a maximum of five capped players (India/overseas) and two uncapped Indians, based on the rules announced by the BCCI on Saturday, following a meeting of the IPL Governing Council in Bengaluru.\\n\"It is at the discretion of the IPL franchise to choose their combination for retentions and RTMs,\" the IPL release said. \\'The six retentions/RTMs can have a maximum of five capped players and a maximum of two uncapped players.\\'\\nIf a player makes his international debut before October 31, he will be considered capped. However, if he is retained by the franchise as an uncapped player, but makes his international debut before the IPL deadline, he will be considered uncapped and the team will only lose INR 4 crore from their purse. The BCCI also announced that the overall purse of all the teams have been increased by 33.34 per cent to INR 120 crore for the auction.\\nThe IPL also revived the \"uncapped player\" rule for the auction, which was discarded in 2021. According to the rule, as explained in the IPL statement released on Saturday, \"a capped Indian player will become uncapped, if the player has in the last five calendar years preceding the year in which the relevant Season is held, not played in the starting XI in International Cricket (Test match, ODI, Twenty20 International) or does not have a Central Contract with BCCI. This will be applicable for Indian Players only.\" The rule will hence allow Chennai Super Kings to retain their former captain MS Dhoni, who last played an international game in the 2019 World Cup and announced his retirement a year later, as an uncapped player.\\nRead more news like this on HindustanTimes.com\\n\\nJ&K police head constable Bashir Ahmed killed after gunning down terrorist in Kathua encounter\\nNone\\nNEW DELHI: A Jammu and Kashmir Police Head Constable, Bashir Ahmed, was killed on Sunday during a fierce encounter with terrorists in the Kathua district.

(Nelson) Mandela was 26 when he co-founded the ANC Youth League. Malala (Yousafzai) was 11 when she gave her first protest speech. And my hero (William) Wilberforce was 21 when he entered into politics. So we have to get our skates on.\\'\\nThe Associated Press spoke with Evans shortly before Saturday\\'s Global Citizen Festival in New York, am event headlined by superstars like Post Malone and Doja Cat, as well as breakout artists like Benson Boone and Rauw Alejandro. The festival generated more than $1 billion in new commitments to fight extreme poverty, as well as a new partnership with FIFA in which Global Citizen supporters get tickets to matches by taking action on humanitarian issues.\\nThe interview was edited for clarity and length. Q: Can you talk about the Global Citizen Festival\\'s importance?\\nA: We\\'re operating against the backdrop of a world with constant shocks -- the ongoing shock of recovering from the pandemic and now the shocks of global conflicts. That has resulted in the first time in our lifetime where poverty for the last three years has been on the increase. We\\'re talking about 719 million people now living on less than $2.15 a day worldwide. The other big shock that the world hasn\\'t yet fully experienced is the shock of climate change, which has the potential to push another 100 million people into extreme poverty in the next ten years. Q: You asked Global Citizen supporters to write their leaders about fully funding the World Bank\\'s International Development Association. You want them to encourage Colombia to stop providing licenses to companies seeking to drill in the Amazon. And you\\'re hoping to raise $250 million to provide education for 72 million kids currently out of school due to conflict.\\nA: Those are our big pushes this time. We want to address the reality that the world is confronting multiple crises at once. Q: During United Nations General Assembly Week last week, many groups did outreach to Generation Z. Global Citizen has done that for years.\\nA: Based on our most recent data, over 70% of our members are Gen Z. We need to continue to double down on that. It\\'s fueled by the reality that I think we have a model of activism powered through the Global Citizen app that young people can relate to. And it gives them the power of putting activism and advocacy within their own hands. I think that our approach has always been to try to equip young people with the best, most thoughtful policy asks that are backed by incredible research and data and have the ability to have the most profound impact to bring an end to extreme poverty.\\nAssociated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP\\'s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

[+] Art/Getty Images)\\nWorld War II did not just pick up from where World War I left off—it completely changed modern warfare, military strategies and the global order. The Treaty of Versailles and other unresolved issues from the First World War may have laid some foundation for the conflict, but the Second World War expanded its scope and left a lasting mark on international diplomacy, technology and human rights. Because of this impact, World War II has been memorialized in many works of literature and adaptations, including everything from war fiction and memoirs to biographies, military history and speculative fiction, inspiring writers across genres and countless war movies. Some of the most notable World War II works include William Shirer\\'s The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, Stephen Ambrose\\'s Band of Brothers, and Kristin Hannah\\'s The Nightingale. On this list, I have compiled 20 books that everyone should read to understand the world\\'s deadliest war better, and these rankings are based on public reception, cultural impact and longevity. Each work offers a different structure and understanding of a time in history and gives context to the experiences of those who lived through the war—soldiers on the front lines, civilians enduring the home front and leaders—whether visionary or Machiavellian— strategically tackling diplomatic challenges.\\nWorld War II is one of the most complicated wars in history and understanding the sheer scope of how the war affected people can feel understandably overwhelming. In this book, acclaimed American Civil War historian and academic Frank E. Vandiver breaks the complex pieces down into bite-sized chunks, giving readers a more straightforward way to comprehend parts of the war that changed the 20th century and continues to affect world order. Vandiver\\'s approach to this book is holistic, chronological and enriched with a global perspective that covers the war\\'s strategies, technologies and social influences. Vandiver designed the book to interest newcomers and history enthusiasts, so this book is the first credible step toward understanding the overarching influence of the Second World War.\\nWho should read this?: This book offers a useful historical guide for anyone just beginning to learn about the Second World War.\\nWhere can you read rent/buy this book?: Barnes & Noble.\\n2nd New Zealand Division infantry from XXX Corps of the British 8th Army take the surrender of a ...

(Photo by George Silk/Australian Photo Unit/FPG/).\\nLeah Garrett\\'s X Troop is a well-researched account of Jewish refugees who escaped persecution and later became part of Britain\\'s elite special forces during World War II. After the Third Reich spread across Europe, Winston Churchill and his chief of staff came up with a controversial plan: to form a new commando unit made up of Jewish refugees who had escaped to Britain. This heroic unit, which would become known as X Troop, was composed of visionaries, artists, and athletes—many of whom had interned as enemy aliens. Garrett\\'s detailed research draws from extensive archival research, including declassified military documents, war diaries, and interviews with surviving members and their families adds a rich backdrop to this account.\\nWho should read this?: Readers who are interested in underreported World War II stories.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Harper Collins Publishers.\\nDunnigan and Nofi\\'s Dirty Little Secrets of World War II is an expose of the unknown secrets and strategies that informed the strategic decisions behind the war. The book primarily focuses on introduces snippets of information about the war called \"infobytes,\" which emphasize the lesser-known parts of the war. In writing this book, Dunnigan and Nofi also approach the Second World War from an interrogative perspective created to give readers a new outlook on the war, including high-tech inventions like electronic warfare and nuclear missiles. Overall, Dunnigan and Nofi\\'s collaboration contextualizes a lot of detail for the average reader in a way that conventional history books often overlook.\\nWho should read this?: This book is a good read for history buffs who want to have a deeper understanding of the war, especially those interested in the hidden strategies and technological innovations that influenced the outcome of the war.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Barnes & Noble.\\nRay Monk\\'s biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer gives insight into the keen mind of the mysterious, often caustic theoretical physicist and his role in The Manhattan Project, a research and development program undertaken during World War II that would produce the first nuclear weapons that would forever alter the 20th century. This memoir is not simply a flat retelling of historical facts; instead, it surveys the web of scientific ambition, ethical dilemma and personal affliction that defined Oppenheimer\\'s contribution to developing nuclear energy during and after World War II and the high stakes that came along with creating the atomic bomb. Monk\\'s A Life Inside The Center focuses on Oppenheimer\\'s internal conflict as a man proud of his scientific achievements but also struggling with the guilt of the atomic bomb\\'s consequences.\\nWho should read: Readers who are fascinated with brilliant protagonists battling with moral dilemmas and unintended consequences.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Penguin Random House.\\nFew leaders in the 20th century have conjured as much global condemnation as Adolf Hitler, and Ian Kershaw\\'s Hitler 1936-1945: Nemesis offers a paralleled view into Hitler, specifically from his most dictatorial years and ultimate demise. Kershaw\\'s inquiry into Hitler\\'s life offers a penetrating look into the damaging and tyrannical leadership of one of the most infamous dictators in history. But it\\'s not just Hitler under a microscope; in this book, the people around him who formed the baseline that allowed Hitler to claim power within Europe are examined, too, including the broader socio-political environment and the German public\\'s complicity.\\nWho should read: Readers who want to learn more about the unprecedented run of Europe\\'s most notorious dictator and the historical implications of his legacy.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Penguin Random House.\\nAndrew Roberts\\' Churchill: Walking with Destiny is a thoughtful biography of one of Britain\\'s most acclaimed political leaders and his impact on the Second World War. Roberts\\' biography of Churchill is enriched with new material of supporting evidence at his disposal, including private diaries, letters and archival documents, which he uses to give history buffs a closer look at Winston Churchill—both as an iconic statesman who was passionate about the future of Britain and as a complex, non-conforming leader who was not afraid to approach war strategy and conflict in a non-traditional way.\\nWho should read: This book will interest readers who enjoy detailed historical analysis, as it provides a well-rounded view of Churchill as a flawed human, yet brilliant leader.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Penguin Random House.\\nBritish military historian Antony Beevor\\'s D-Day: The Battle for Normandy is one of the most visceral books on this list. By relying on a range of primary sources, Beevor, through prudent attention to detail, gives an authoritative interpretation of the execution and aftermath of the Normandy invasion and is praised for covering the event from its planning stages to the liberation of Paris. Beevor proves to be an effective storyteller by giving voice to soldiers from various nations and addressing the civilian toll, particularly on the French population. His attention to sensory detail—describing sights, sounds, and emotions—does more than narrate the true events of the brutal war; it immerses readers into the when and where of the war.\\nWho should read: War history buffs who enjoy books with detailed research and analysis will appreciate this book.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Penguin Random House.\\nUnited States Army Air Forces Eighth Air Force walk away from their aircraft after their bombing ...

On 23rd January 1943 B-17F #41-24607 Jerry Jinx was shot down by German Luftwaffe fighters during a mission to bomb the port area of Lorient and Brest U-boat submarine pens. All the crew in the picture were killed except for Rear Gunner Sgt Bernard Jurosek who had been assigned to another aircraft and replaced by Sgt. Roger Milford before the raid. Bernard Jurosek completed his tour of 25 operational combat missions as a B-17 tail gunner and died in 2005 aged 85.

The story is told from the perspective of the Henry family. It follows Victor \\'Pug\\' Henry, his wife, Rhoda, and their three grown children six months before Germany invades Poland in September 1939, and ends shortly after the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941. Wouk\\'s scaled combination of fiction and true-life events includes cameos from World War II leaders like Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin. While the novel touches on the military, diplomatic, and personal challenges of the time, it also connects to lesser-known details of intelligence work and operations influencing wartime strategies. The Henry family becomes the central part of the novel, helping Wouk to weave this story together using drama, romance and heroism. These combinations of well-known historical events and obscure details make Wouk\\'s perspective on World War II memorable.\\nWho should read: Enthusiasts who approve of historical narrations of events with a dose of fiction.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Hachette Book Group.\\nGuy Sajer\\'s The Forgotten Soldier is a powerful memoir that engages readers in the vanguard of the Eastern Front during World War II. Sajer, a French-German soldier, presents war as a struggle for survival, and he does so by describing the hunger, fatigue and constant deprivation that formed the core of his relationship with war. Some historians argue that the book leans towards a Roman à-clef—a novelized memoir—rather than a strictly factual account. However, many veterans and readers still consider it a valuable representation of the German soldier\\'s experience on the Eastern Front. Sajer noted the imperfections in his account but shared that he wrote The Forgotten Soldier based on his experience during a very stressful time and his recollection may not have been perfect.\\nWho should read: Readers interested in memoirs that narrate significant moments in history.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Barnes & Noble.\\nThe author of A Woman in Berlin was a mystery for over forty years. It wasn\\'t until 2003, after she died, that readers found out that Marta Hillers, a German journalist, wrote this gutting memoir. The book itself, a compilation of Hiller\\'s diary during the war, begins on Friday, 20 April 1945, Hitler\\'s 56th birthday, during a period when the Russian army was at the edge of Berlin. In this book, Hillers gives an honest perspective of the violence that she and many women faced in the aftermath of the war and their attempts at self-preservation despite the dangers they faced. Hillers\\' account of assaulted women, including herself, forming relationships with Soviet officers for protection shows just how the devastating toll of the war, especially on women, and her commentary is not just unvarnished; it is a brave account of the war\\'s civilian cost.\\nWho should read: Readers who are not afraid to read about memoirs about rare and unfiltered account\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Macmillan Publishers.\\nRick Atkinson\\'s Pulitzer-winning book An Army at Dawn: The War in North Africa, 1942–1943, is a well-researched literary review of the North African campaign during WWII. It is the first book in Atkinson\\'s Liberation Trilogy. The book takes readers on a journey back in time and analyzes the American army\\'s initial challenges and eventual triumphs as they powered through the challenges of Operation Torch and the difficult battles in Tunisia. Atkinson relies on first-hand resources like letters, personal diaries of soldiers and military documents to give every reader the most inverted account of the war possible. Atkinson points more than to the steep learning curve that the inexperienced American army faced; he also points to evolving cooperation among Allied forces. The account also focuses on the story\\'s human importance—the commanders and soldiers, their on-the-ground experiences and the challenges faced by key figures like Dwight D. Eisenhower and general George S. Patton Jr.\\nWho should read: Readers who are interested in understanding the strategic, tactical and operational aspects of the war.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Barnes & Noble.\\nAntony Beevor\\'s Stalingrad brings the brutal siege to life through interviews with survivors and military documents from both German and Soviet archives. Although the book touches on Operation Barbarossa, Germany\\'s invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, it zones in on the Battle of Stalingrad and the brutal combat, strategic moves and war crimes committed on both sides of the battle. Beevor also offers a backward look in time to August 1942, when Hitler\\'s Sixth Army reached the city, setting the stage for one of the war\\'s most dramatic turning points—the Soviet counteroffensive and eventual victory. Each chapter has a multi-layered depiction of the human suffering, starvation and brutality that defined the critical battle.\\nWho should read: This book is a valuable text for history students, specifically those interested in World War II, Soviet history or military strategy.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Penguin Random House.\\nAll the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr is a book that combines the stories of two young characters—Marie-Laure LeBlanc, a blind French girl, and Werner Pfennig, a German boy whose radio engineering talents gets him enlisted into the Nazi regime, where he uses his skills to locate and intercept illegal broadcasts from the French Resistance. This talent eventually led Werner to cross paths with Marie-Laure when his mission to track illegal radio broadcasts during the German occupation of France brought him to the coastal town of Saint-Malo. History fans have praised Doerr for his lyrical storytelling and nonlinear plot, which follows both protagonists in alternating chapters. Doerr\\'s depiction of the connection between the two protagonists, regardless of their different backgrounds, is a memorable contribution to fictional interpretations of the Second World War. This book is a brilliant addition to the literature of World War II and is one of the best fictional interpretations of the Second World War on this list. The novel received was well-received by enthusiasts and won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2015.\\nWho should read: Readers who enjoy historical fiction with strong protagonists who lead important lives.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Simon & Schuster.\\nMembers of the US Army Women\\'s Auxiliary Army Corps (WAAC) modelling uniforms, 1942. (Photo by ... [+])\\nIn A Bridge Too Far, Cornelius Ryan tells the story of Operation Market Garden, the ambitious yet ill-fated Allied plan to seize a series of bridges in Nazi-occupied Netherlands, aiming to break through German defenses at Arnhem during World War II. Cornelius Ryan\\'s A Bridge Too Far is a seminal work on Operation Market Garden, one of the most ambitious yet ultimately failed military operations of World War II. Ryan\\'s relies on interviews with soldiers and civilians alike makes this a must-read for anyone looking to understand the complicated war operations. The operation, devised by British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, aimed to seize key bridges in Nazi-occupied Netherlands to create a path for an Allied invasion of Germany by Christmas 1944, and like several entries on this list, Ryan\\'s analysis probes into the strategic analysis with personal stories from soldiers and civilians. The operation, which combined airborne and ground forces, was supposed to capture five strategic bridges and it required precise coordination between British, American and Polish forces, but suffered from poor intelligence, logistical issues and unexpected German resistance. The failure to secure the final bridge at Arnhem—a \\'bridge too far\\'—caused the collapse of the mission.\\nWho should read: Readers interested in World War II history, particularly lesser-known but pivotal campaigns, A Bridge Too Far is a must-read.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Simon & Schuster.\\nStephen E. Ambrose\\'s Band of Brothers takes a fascinating look at the lives of the men of Easy Company, who were a part of the esteemed 101st Airborne Division. The book closely follows the journeys of the former members of E Company, 2nd Battalion and 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, who were part of the 101st Airborne Division and traces their history from the rigid training grounds in Georgia to the front lines of Europe\\'s most crucial battlegrounds. Ambrose, who relied on interviews from soldiers about their brutal experiences on the frontlines, did not just focus on the grueling aspects of war, but the friendships that the soldiers formed with other men as they parachuted into France on D-Day and survived the harsh winter during the Battle of the Bulge.\\nWho should read: Readers who are interested in acute accounts of the war and how it psychologically impacted me.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Simon & Schsuter.\\nLaura Hillenbrand\\'s Unbroken is the true story of Louis Zamperini, a once troubled child of Italian immigrants who turned to track and field to turn his life around in his early years. Hillenbrand follows Louis\\' passion for running and his eventual career trajectory as an Olympic track star whose athletic ambitions would abruptly be interrupted by the onset of World War II. The war, which would eventually push Louis to enlist in the United States Army Air Corps, where his story of grit and survival would form. After his plane getting shot down during the war, Louis would spend 47 days on a raft in the Pacific Ocean, and then be tortured mercilessly in Japanese POW camps. In this non-fictional body of work, Hillenbrand goes beyond merely recounting Louis\\' physical endurance; she incisively looks into his life after release—his struggles with faith, relationships, God and his path back to healing and inspiration. Unbroken spent more than four years on The New York Times best-seller list and is the fifth longest-running nonfiction best-seller of all time.\\nWho should read: Readers who are interested in stories that are centered around grit with the historical backdrop of World War II.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Barnes & Noble.\\nPhoto taken during the World War II of planes flying above a Dutch city. (Photo credit should read ... [+] AFP via Getty Images)\\nIn this book, acclaimed historian William Shirer draws from firsthand sources to create this book, which offers an encyclopedic interpretation of the Nazi era and the Holocaust while arguing that German history followed a logical progression from Martin Luther to Adolf Hitler. In The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, Shirer suggests that some aspects of German national character, culture and history contributed to Hitler\\'s rise, but he does not solely attribute Hitler\\'s rise to these factors. His reporting in this book takes a chronological look at the rise and fall of Nazi Germany, beginning with Adolf Hitler\\'s birth and ending in World War II in Europe in 1945. His analysis dissects the political, social, and economic currents that pushed a nation into totalitarianism, along with the events and personalities that influenced that period.\\nWho should read: The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand the origins of a dictatorial regime that brought the world to the brink of destruction.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Simon & Schuster.\\nKristin Hannah\\'s The Nightingale is a tribute to the unsung heroines of World War II and a close follow-up to the inspiring story of two sisters in Nazi-occupied France. Vianne and Isabelle, with two distinct personalities, approached revolting against the tyrannical German regime in their separate ways. Vianne, the more reclusive of the two sister decided to protect Jewish children by hiding them, while Isabelle, the more rebellious and stubborn sister, joined the French Resistance, a group of people who fought the Nazis and the Vichy regime in France during the Second World War. Although fictional, Hannah\\'s depiction of this story adds insight to a topic that has historically received less attention: the women\\'s war and its imprint on history.\\nWho should read: Readers moved by war-themed stories with brave female protagonists.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Macmillan Publishers.\\nWWII - Soldiers in ruined building looking through a window, one pointing a gun, the other looking ...

Official War Office photograph. (Photo by)\\nThanks to Joseph Heller, the term \\'Catch-22\\' has become a part of the global pop culture lexicon, which means any situation where contradictory rules or conditions trap a person. In this satire, Heller tells the story of Captain Yossarian, a frustrated bombardier stationed on a Mediterranean island during World War II, who becomes increasingly desperate to survive after he suspects the military is trying to kill him. The novel is not just brilliant because of its absurdity; its dark humor and philosophical themes within the story create a plot that is both hilarious and unsettling. Heller\\'s description of the bureaucratic nature of military life is spot-on, while his sharp critique of war and authority resonates with many people. Because of this, this book has become a cornerstone of modern literature and one that continues to challenge, entertain and encourage conversation.\\nWho should read: People who enjoy fictional works that tackle serious topics through biting satire.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Simon & Schuster.\\nKurt Vonnegut\\'s Slaughterhouse-Five is more than just an anti-war American classic novel; it follows the fractured lens of Billy Pilgrim, a barber\\'s son, turned drafted soldier who becomes \\'unstuck in time,\" especially after surviving the apocalyptic firebombing of Dresden. In this novel, Vonnegut defies linear storytelling, much like the chaotic nature of war itself, to follow Billy\\'s disorienting journey through time and space as a reflection of the randomness and unpredictability that life—and war—imposes. Vonnegut repeatedly juxtaposes the real-life horrors of war with moments of dark humor to create an unconventional depiction of the war, which is inspired by Vonnegut\\'s own experiences as a prisoner of war in Dresden during World War II.\\nWho should read: Readers who have a taste for dark, satirical humor will find that Slaughterhouse-Five consistently delivers.\\nWhere can you read/rent/buy this book?: Penguin Random House.\\nMany World War II books, fictional or not, have become important heirlooms of moments in time offering different generations of readers insight into one of the most devastating conflicts in human history. From personal diaries like Anne Frank\\'s to detailed military accounts, these works break the mold and continue to remind readers about the global impact of the Second World War.',\n",

The miracle of Medinah. It's coming!' The words there of Carlota Ciganda as she closed out her and Emily Pedersen's 2&1 win over Lexi Thompson and Ally Ewing yesterday evening. Well, as far as Europe are concerned, it better be. What a tall order. But at least the omens are good, because Europe were 10-4 down in the 2012 Ryder Cup on Saturday afternoon with two matches left out on the course, and reduced the arrears to 10-6 ahead of the Sunday singles, which is exactly what the Europeans did yesterday when things were threatening to go seriously south at the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club in Virginia. So let's remember what happened after that Ryder Cup comeback 12 years ago …\\n… but while Ciganda brought that one up, it'd be a shocking dereliction of duty not to point out that the Solheim Cup has one of these Sunday stunners of its own. In 2015, at St Leon-Rot in Germany, Europe held a 10-6 lead going into the singles, only to capitulate to an 8½-3½ defeat and a 14½-13½ loss overall.\\nEurope's pain that day is obviously why Ciganda preferred to reference Medinah, but there are also a couple of other reasons why St Leon-Rot is not exactly analogous. The USA needed an extra half-point to win back the trophy that year (as holders, Europe only need eight to retain it this time), and it all happened in the heightened wake of the awful rules brouhaha involving Suzann Pettersen the night before. So … OK, I'll fess up, I'm not exactly sure what point I'm making here … but you can look at Medinah and St Leon-Rot at different wonky angles through a smudged prism and argue that history either gives Europe hope, or simply shows the USA – this time fuelled by stopping their opponents from becoming the first side to lift the cup four times in a row, rather than the injustice of a technical imbroglio – will easily walk this home. QED? Nope! Nah! But the USA are obviously strong favourites.\\nHere are the tee times. It might be a procession. It might be a comeback for the ages. Either way, a fantastic team of world-class talent will lift the Solheim Cup when it all comes down. God speed, everyone, and may the best women win.

The event was originally launched last year in Las Vegas by San Francisco Spirits Competition's parent organization, The Tasting Alliance. 2024 marks the first time that it'll be hosted in the competition's home city. And it looks to be the biggest incarnation yet; a fusion of consumer and trade featuring multiple tasting rooms, dozens of master classes, and over 80 different brands with liquids on offer.\\nThis time around those master classes will include one on small batch American whiskey hosted by Brother's Bond co-founder Ian Somerhalder. There's a seminar on the art of independent bottling from Richard Urquhart of Gordon & MacPhail. Leo Gibson, co-founder of Bhakta Spirits takes people on a journey through the Armagnac Category. And Ewan Morgan, national luxury ambassador for Diageo, will lead lucky attendees through some of the rarest scotches from formerly shuttered sites known as Ghost Distilleries.\\nVIP entrance, which include a token to attend one of these masterclasses—along with early access and gourmet food pairings—go for $300 per ticket.

Impressive, but even more so was their dedicated attention to their craft and the joy they were giving to their audience.\\nI stood back and regarded the very interesting configuration of the different booths that beckoned the visitors, each with their unique cultural offerings. Peru, Palestine, Iran, Ireland, India and many more countries were represented and captured the attention of a very large and curious crowd. Children love crafts, activities and fun and there were plenty to choose from as the diverse settings garnered the attention of countless kids. 'SVHS Unity Starts Here Club' and the 'Asian American Pacific Islander Club' were entertaining lots of visitors. And impressively, the planning and execution of this event was driven mostly by the high school students.\\nMy high school experience typically offered a United Nations Day, where the guys would dress up in a suit and tie to discuss and debate solutions to a meaty subject or two like, 'Will East and West Germany ever re-unite?' or 'Is World Peace Possible?' A little contrived. The Multicultural Fair was different. Much more purposeful, organic and real. My John Lennon 'Imagine' moment asked: What if we dropped these kids onto the world stage and let them solve an international issue or two? Dreamin'? Standing on that field, if you listened, there was a whisper of love, hope and peace, as if on this day, all things were possible. Who knows? President Clinton was poignant when he stated, 'More unites us than divides us.' It's hard, but don't stop believing.\\nAs mentioned, the day was hot and that meant a trip to Santa Cruz for some relief. After a smash burger at West End Tap, we drove another half mile to West Cliff, where we got only a micro-dose of cool air, but it was sufficient to continue a walk. A drive down the coast led us to East Cliff and right around Sunny Cove, there it was: not one, not two, but three 12-year-olds riding on the same e-bike with no helmets, on the sidewalk, going the wrong way. Wow. Talk about a clear and present danger to themselves and to drivers.\\nAbout a month ago, I brought up this topic at a City Council meeting and it must have hit a nerve as many in the chamber, like me, have had close encounters with these silent, but swift little machines. A councilmember even had one hit her car as she pulled away from a stop sign. My initial remedy was to have our police hold a morning instructional seminar to be attended by unlicensed riders/drivers, to help reduce the possibility of injury. The very real question is should these young riders be required to have some sort of formal permit? Sadly, I read where a couple of young dirt e-bike riders were seriously injured in Santa Cruz, so the problem is real.\\nOn Scotts Valley Drive, I recently saw a couple of high school students riding on an e-bike. The passenger clung to the driver with one hand and in the other she carried a pastry and a latte. (Well-balanced but a little dangerous.) She had a helmet, but the driver did not. Stopped at the light, in a polite voice, I admonished her that she should be wearing a helmet. 'We only have one,' was her response and with the green light scooted down Glenwood Drive toward the high school. Probably going to need a little more help from the parents on this problem as the cautionary request of 'Be safe,' is not being heard.\\nRandy L.

Her status as both a victim (her childhood rape is revealed in a jarringly clumsy exchange with her friend and employer, Vogue editor Audrey Withers, played by Andrea Riseborough) and a survivor brought her an unusual empathy with her subjects. She saw the micro-details of combat in a way that her male counterparts frequently overlooked – not just the role played by the unheralded everywoman on the street, but also the shame and humiliation felt by those whom the war had chewed up and spat out along the way. The directorial debut of American cinematographer Ellen Kuras (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), Lee is not the most formally daring or original biopic. It is, however, undeniably impactful: a woman's-eye view of a photographer who cast a woman's eye over the war and its aftermath.\\nIt's a remarkable performance from Winslet, who, while she's a touch too old for the role (Miller was in her mid-30s when she covered the war), captures the spirit of the character: the brawling, confrontational tough-broad aspects of Miller's personality, as well as her considerable magnetism. Winslet's Lee is a woman who uses her words as weapons, delivered in a hardboiled screwball heroine's rasp of a voice. It's a voice that is employed extensively. A fictional interview device – a chain-smoking, whisky-swilling older Lee is interrogated by a younger man (Josh O'Connor) – provides a narration that ties together her war experiences.\\nBut Winslet's performance goes deeper than the 'drinking, fucking and taking photographs' that Miller lists as her core skillset at the film's opening, which unfolds at a bohemian pool party in France on the brink of war. She balances the tough-cookie determination that took Miller to a frontline that was, nominally at least, off-limits to women, with a sense of the psychological injuries she accrued.\\nAlong with her friend and colleague, Life magazine photographer David E Scherman (Andy Samberg), Miller was one of the very first civilians to bear witness to the atrocities of the Nazi concentration camps at Buchenwald and Dachau. What she saw there haunted her for the rest of her life – something that Winslet conveys in a single, wordless scene in which she sifts through her contact sheets, her ever-present cigarette burning down to its filter and a cloud gathering in her eyes.\\nNot surprisingly given Kuras's background as a cinematographer, Lee is largely visually driven. Adapted from the biography The Lives of Lee Miller, written by her son, Antony Penrose, the film also benefits from extensive access to Miller's private archives, a gift of a resource for a film-maker that enables Kuras to see the world literally through the eyes of her subject. Notable photographs – some famous, some less so – are threaded organically through the film. Meanwhile, the use of colour – there's a stark contrast between the frivolous, saturated hues of prewar life and the purgatorial greys of postwar Germany – gives a neat indication of Lee's mental state at any given time.\\nThe film's soundtrack, however, is less successful. The score, by Alexandre Desplat, is a bustling, busy orchestral mulch, so generic that it might as well have been pulled out of a drawer marked 'prestige period pieces'. When so much elsewhere in the picture makes such an effort to tap into the distinctive and highly unusual character of Lee Miller, the music choices feel throwaway and thoughtless in comparison.\\nIn UK and Irish cinemas\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

For younger readers, and older ones with ailing memories, Black Wednesday, on 16 September 1992, was the day the Tories lost their reputation for economic competence.\\nTrue, they had lost it once before, when the Heath government of 1970-74 fell victim to the inflationary impact of the 1973-74 oil crisis, their economic boom that got out of control, and what became known as the disaster of the three-day week.\\nBut it did not take long for the Wilson/Callaghan Labour governments of 1974-79 to fall foul in turn of the same accusation. Public borrowing started to spiral and Labour had to go 'cap in hand' to be rescued by a loan from the International Monetary Fund.\\nIn came the Thatcher government of 1979-90, followed by the Major government of 1990-97. I have written extensively about what I regard as the mistakes of the Thatcher period, but it was the enforced exit of the pound from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) on Black Wednesday that was universally agreed to have put an end to the Conservatives' reputation for economic competence.\\nThose were pre-euro days, and the principal motive of Lawson and Major was to tie the pound's fortunes to the Deutschmark, postwar Germany having had a well-deserved reputation for controlling inflation.\\nUnfortunately, our entry could hardly have been worse timed. German inflation took off as a result of the enormous cost of absorbing the east German economy under the process of reunification – itself a welcome and historic event.\\nThe fact of the matter was that the pound had been attached to the D-mark at the wrong time, at the wrong exchange rate, and for the wrong reasons. The Lawson boom of 1988-89 had led to the second worst recession since the second world war, but the high interest rates imposed by the Bundesbank, the German central bank, to combat German inflation were holding back other members of the ERM.\\nAt a meeting of European finance ministers and central bank governors in Bath, Norman Lamont, who had succeeded Major as chancellor, tried to bully the Germans into reducing interest rates and therefore the pressure on the pound. Dr Helmut Schlesinger, the president of the Bundesbank, took strong exception to this. The German view was that the pound was overvalued, and that it was up to the British to deal with that problem.\\nTo cut a long story short – and the markets were going short of the pound – the belief that the UK could not maintain an overvalued currency became overwhelming, and speculation forced the pound out of the ERM. This eased our economy's competitive position, and economic recovery became sustainable. The following Sunday I suggested in my column that Schlesinger should be given a knighthood for having helped the British economy to escape from recession.\\nWell, I can report that, although he was never awarded that honour, my friend Helmut Schlesinger is in fine fettle, and recently celebrated his 100th birthday.\\nWithin months, Lamont said he had been 'singing in the bath' as a result of the easing of economic conditions. (He had certainly not being singing in Bath after his humiliating experience.) But Major had not been amused by the way Lamont had handled the Bath meeting, and replaced him with Kenneth Clarke, who handed over an economy in reasonable shape to Gordon Brown in 1997.\\nSign up to Observed\\nAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers\\nafter newsletter promotion\\nThere are swings and roundabouts in economic policy, and it was Labour's turn again to lose its reputation in 2010, when the Conservatives launched a brilliant, and deeply cynical, campaign to accuse Labour and its supposed overspending for having caused the 2007-09 financial crisis, when it was – as the then top Treasury official at the time, Sir Nicholas (now Lord) Macpherson, pointed out – 'a banking crisis, pure and simple'.\\nThe result of that successful propaganda is that the current chancellor, my (almost) new friend Rachel Reeves, is obsessed by the perceived need to win back a reputation for economic competence. Unfortunately, so far she has been going about it the wrong way: penalising the poor while threatening tax increases for rich investors whom she is supposed to be wooing for investment in the UK.\\nWe await her first budget on 30 October. What she should be doing is taking a long-term view of borrowing for investment that should benefit future generations, and a long-, medium- and short-term view that we should apply to re-enter the European customs union and single market as soon as possible, thereby fulfilling the promise in the Labour manifesto (do older readers remember that?) to reduce barriers to trade – of which the most glaringly obvious is Brexit.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

But it wasn't until last month that BMW realized as many as 1.5 million cars might contain the defective part, supplied by car-parts maker Continental AG and touted as a lighter and more efficient system.\\nA profit warning last week wiped €5 billion off BMW's value, a debacle for a premium-car maker known as a driving-tech leader.\\nBMW launched an in-depth review into the braking system in October 2023, the recall document shows, which found interference affecting the electric signals sent through the brake system. The first recall of about 80,000 vehicles followed in the US in February this year.\\nThat has since snowballed to encompass 1.5 million cars across multiple brands made by BMW — including $420,000 Rolls-Royce Spectres, flagship 7-Series sedans and high-powered XM sport utility vehicles.\\n'This isn't just an ordinary recall, this is a significant shock,' said Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, director at the Center for Automotive Research in Bochum. 'What's also noteworthy is that BMW has been stepping up quality control among suppliers with a taskforce, indicating they see risks more broadly.'\\n'BMW is usually very cautious, preferring stability over short-term peaks, which is reflected in their margins,' he added.\\nBy US law, carmakers risk fines if they don't report safety issues in a timely way to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In some cases a manufacturer may reasonably be unaware of a defect even after an extended period. The NHTSA hasn't fined BMW over the brakes recall.\\nA spokeswoman for BMW said that it took time to gauge the scale and financial impact of the recall, adding that the automaker needed to discuss the matter with officials across multiple markets and assess how much fixes would cost.\\nA recall notice Rolls-Royce sent to its American dealers in March, seen by Bloomberg News, shows the company was aware at the time that it had a problem with one of its most prestigious brands.\\nIn capital letters, the luxury carmaker ordered a halt to sales and deliveries of all Spectres built between June 20, 2023 and June 23, 2023. The model's braking system was potentially faulty, and a mechanic would have to follow a 26-step process to fix affected autos.\\nThe US recall eventually ballooned to 688 Spectres built between January 2023 and July 2024, more than a quarter of the vehicles produced each year. Given recalls in other markets, the total number of Spectres affected is likely higher.\\nThe braking system that prompted the recall is known as brake-by-wire, which uses electronic impulses instead of the hydraulic technology built into most car brakes since the 1920s. Its components are a cornerstone product for Continental's auto unit, which is in the process of being spun off.\\nYet problems soon arose with a 'power braking' feature meant to reduce the amount of force needed to activate the brakes. The feature failed to fully activate in some vehicles, according to the recall document seen by Bloomberg. Physically weaker drivers might struggle to apply the necessary pressure in emergency situations as a result, increasing the risk of a crash.\\nContinental traced the defect back to a plant in Hungary. Workers producing the brakes' circuit boards there failed to maintain a sufficiently clean environment, leaving smudges or dust on the components that hampered the system's performance, according to people familiar with the matter.\\nNo accidents or injuries have been reported as a result of the braking fault. But with repairs expected to take months and ultimate costs still unclear, the crisis marks the latest hit to Germany's most important industry. The sector is already under a cloud as electric-vehicle sales slow and European manufacturers face headwinds in China. Volkswagen AG warned earlier this month that it may shutter factories in the country for the first time.\\nAndrew Graves, an automotive analyst and emeritus professor at the University of Bath, said a rising number of recalls are raising 'serious questions' regarding automakers' due diligence of their supply chains.\\n'Perhaps the sector needs to focus and concentrate on core competences to avoid such issues in the future?' he said in an emailed comment.\\n--With assistance from Veronika Gulyas and Monica Raymunt.\\n(Updates with new comments in final two paragraphs.)\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

With the price tags of designer dresses easily running into the tens of thousands, donations are the only way comparatively less wealthy occupants of the White House could afford to wear star designers.\\'For official events of public or historic significance, such as a state visit, the first lady\\'s clothes may be given as a gift by a designer and accepted on behalf of the U.S. government,\\' Mrs Rosholm said.\\nThe Smithsonian Museum lists the dress current first lady Jill Biden wore at her husband\\'s 2021 inauguration as a donation of designer Alexandria O\\'Neil \\'in honour of first lady Jill Biden\\' – an indication the designer lent her the dress.By contrast, it appears that her predecessor Melania Trump, whose husband\\'s wealth made him the richest president in history, donated her inaugural dress, designed by Hervé Pierre, herself. That may be because she paid for it.In the UK, Sarah Brown, wife of former prime minister Gordon Brown, has spoken of the difficulties around accepting gifts - including clothing - while in Downing Street.\"As I quickly discover,\" she wrote in her book. Behind the Black Door, in 2011, \"there is no shortage of designers and retailers who will offer you free clothes.\"However, there are many rules that govern what MPs (and spouses) can do with free gifts - not to mention the moral aspect of using your position to grab freebies.She explained the solution: \"No10 advisers and I figure out a way that works for everyone. Any clothes that I want to keep, I can buy. \"Any freely offered clothes or jewellery, I can effectively \\'rent\\' for about 10 per cent of the retail value, then return.\"\\nWhat about other countries?\\nSpouses of world leaders elsewhere generally appear to rely on donations for their style choices. France\\'s Brigitte Macron does not have a state-funded budget for clothes and is believed to be lent outfits by Parisian high fashion houses such as Louis Vuitton. According to the 2019 book Madame La Présidente, her office keeps a record of which clothes have been donated to her and which are her own. But her husband, President Emmanuel Macron, has been criticised for his own profligate spending. This year, it was revealed that his office reserved a business class seat on a flight from Paris to Brazil solely to transport two of his suits, at a cost of nearly €4,000 (£3,380).In Germany, ministers were criticised for spending €450,000 on hairdressers, makeup artists and photographers in the first six months of 2023, though there does not appear to be a specific fund for clothing.Asked about Lammy\\'s remarks, a Foreign Office spokesman declined to comment further.Downing Street said of Sir Keir\\'s declaration of clothing donations: \"We sought advice from the authorities on coming to office.\"We believed we had been compliant, however, following further interrogation this month, we have declared further items.\"', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",
       " Document(id_='67c1846d-6c03-47e2-b3ec-9d9ec32a0272', embedding=None, metadata={'title': 'Week Ahead: Four G10 Central Banks Meet, Only The Fed Moves', 'author': 'Marc Chandler', 'published_date': '2024-09-15 08:26:00', 'clean_url': 'seekingalpha.com', 'excerpt': 'The market had been gradually scaling back from speculation of a 50 bp cut this week by the Federal Reserve.', 'topic': 'news', 'country': 'US'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='cemagraphics\\nThe market had been gradually scaling back from speculation of a 50 bp cut this week by the Federal Reserve. The euro and sterling tested important technical support near $1.10 and $1.30 respectively. The Dollar Index ( DXY ) set last week\\'s high after the August CPI. However, the general tone of the markets changed, spurred at least initially by a Dow Jones story that many observers believe was likely planted by a senior Fed official to put a 50 bp cut back on the table. That set the proverbial cat among the pigeons. The odds of a 50 bp cut went up to nearly 50% fat the end of the week from less than 20% at Wednesday\\'s settlement after the August CPI. Several former Fed officials were quoted on the newswires, sympathetic to a larger move. The dollar fell against nearly all the world\\'s currencies in the past two sessions, and the greenback sunk to new lows for the year against the Japanese yen near JPY140.30.\\nThe Federal Reserve is perceived to be reluctant to surprise the market. Many seem to expect another media story during the quiet period, where Fed officials do not talk to the media shortly before an FOMC meeting, to minimize the risk of surprise. Rarely this close to an FOMC meeting have the odds been so close to 50/50. The FOMC meeting and press conference are the key events in the coming days. The Bank of England, Norway\\'s Norges Bank, and the Bank of Japan meet. They are not expected to move, but the market is pricing in 50 bp of cuts by the BOE and a quarter-point cut by Norges Bank before the end of the year. The swaps market has a 10 bp rate hike by the BOJ nearly discounted in December. Several emerging market central banks meet too, but the most interesting will be Brazil. Brazil\\'s central bank began cutting the Selic rate in August 2023, and through May, it had slashed it by 325 bp to 10.50%. At the meeting on September 18, a few hours after the Federal Reserve, Brazil is expected to deliver a 25 bp rate hike. Yet, the strongest emerging market currency last week was the Mexican peso. Its 3.4% gain was nearly twice the rise of the second-best performing EM currency, the Chilean peso (+1.85%). It was the largest weekly advance of the year and came after the judicial reform was approved by Mexico\\'s Senate and the states. AMLO\\'s National Guard proposal will be voted on in the coming days. United States:\\nBefore the FOMC meeting concludes on September 18, the August retail sales, industrial production, and housing starts will be reported. The data is unlikely to have a significant impact on market expectations for Fed policy but will help economists fine-tune Q3 GDP forecasts. We already know that August retail sales disappointed with a 15.13 mln unit (seasonally adjusted annual rate), the weakest since January. Still, of note, it was about 0.5% above the sales from August 2023. The average pace of auto sales this year is about 1% above the average in the first eight months of 2023. Industrial output may have eked out a small gain after falling by 0.6% in July. Say what one wants about re-shoring manufacturing to the US, but through August, the US has shed about 32k manufacturing jobs this year. It had gained 12k manufacturing jobs in the first eight months of 2023. Manufacturing output is flat this year through July, after having risen by 1.4% in Jan-July 2023 period. Meanwhile, housing starts are running about 5% below 2023\\'s pace, which itself was about 13% below the 2022 pace. The Atlanta Fed\\'s GDP tracker stands at 2.5% as of September 9 and the NY Fed tracker is at 2.6% as of September 6.\\nThe FOMC meeting is momentous. It will begin the easing cycle. The key debate is size: 25 bp or 50 bp? As the market turmoil from around mid-July through early August reached a climax, the market priced in high confidence of a 50 bp cut, but as the markets stabilized, the odds were scaled back. However, a Dow Jones report on September 12, revived the speculation. Even a quarter-point cut may be delivered in a dovish fashion if there is no pushback against expectations of at least one and maybe two half-point cuts at the next two meetings (November 7 and December 18). Powell\\'s predecessors, Bernanke, and Yellen, often played down the Summary of Economic Projections (the \"dot plot\"). Powell embraces them, refers to them, and recognizes their limitations; they are a snapshot of the different Fed officials\\' forecasts based on the current information set, which can become dated as the quarter progresses and there is more incoming data. Recall that the median dot in June was for one rate cut, but there were eight officials who saw two cuts being appropriate. The new median is likely to be outside of June\\'s range, and the median dot is likely to be between 75 and 100 bp of cuts. One important consideration is whether the more aggressive profile for this year going to be front-loading what the Fed anticipated it would deliver in 2025 and 2026 or is there some additional easing anticipated. In June, the median dot had Fed funds finishing 2025 between 4.00% and 4.25%. For the end of 2026, the median dot was for Fed funds to be between 3.00% and 3.25%. The Fed funds futures currently imply about a 2.75% rate at the end of 2025 and 2.85% at the end of 2026.\\nUntil the second half of last week, it did not look like the dollar\\'s upside correction to the August slide was over. However, the Dollar Index stalled near 101.85 last week and failed to take out the previous week\\'s high (slightly above 101.90). The Dollar Index gapped lower ahead of the weekend to set the low for the week (slightly below 100.90). The lower end of the range is 100.50. The momentum indicators are not in agreement but the risk of a 50 bp cut may deter dollar buying at the start of the new week. Japan:\\nA common narrative is that the change in the trajectory of Bank of Japan monetary policy caused great market consternation. No doubt there is something there, but the correlations suggest two things: 1) the exchange rate has been more sensitive to long-term rates than short-term rates and 2) the exchange rate is more sensitive to US interest rates than Japanese interest rates (or to the changes of the spreads). The market is confident that the Bank of Japan will stand pat this week, allowing its late July rate hike and the start of QT to continue to be absorbed by businesses and investors. The swaps market has eight basis points of a hike discounted for this year and another 10 bp in the first half of next year. Despite this, the yen has remained firm. Japanese investors have continued to buy foreign assets (yen sales), while the speculators in the CME futures market continued to buy yen and extend their net long position. The BOJ will see August CPI figures before it makes its decision, but the Tokyo CPI has already been reported and this means the national report will add little new. That said, headline CPI likely rose above 3.0% for a new high since last October, after a 2.8% rate for the past three months. The core rate, which excludes fresh food, is likely to have risen for the fifth consecutive month, and at 2.6%, it also would be at the highest since last October.\\nThe dollar fell to a new low for the year ahead of the weekend near JPY140.30. It was arguably dragged lower by the softer US rates. What made BOJ intervention successful was that officials were adept at picking a top to US yields as they did in 2022. Few accounts noting the seemingly effectiveness of the intervention even mention this aspect. In any event, the US 10-year yield may form a base near 3.60%, around 90 bp off the early July high. And if it holds, it may take some pressure off the dollar with the risk-reward changing as the JPY140 level was approached. It was held in late 2023, and the greenback has not traded below there since July 2023. Initial resistance may be near JPY141.00, but it may require a move above JPY141.50 to be notable. United Kingdom:\\nIn late July, the swaps market flirted with a Bank of England rate cut this week, but it was on a closing basis never better than a 50/50 proposition. The odds now are seen at less than 20%. After this week\\'s meeting, there are two more before the end of the year. The market has two cuts discounted. Two quarter-point cuts this year would bring the base rate to 4.5%. The swaps market sees the rate near 3.60% in the middle of next year. Ahead of the BOE meeting, August\\'s CPI will be reported. The UK\\'s headline inflation rose at an annualized pace of less than 1% in the three months through July. This likely overstates the disinflationary pressure, but there is scope for a decline in the year-over-year pace (2.2% in July) in August and September before firming in Q4 and into January 2025. The core rate has been stickier, but 1) it has not risen on a year-over-year basis since May 2023, and 2) it has been a little more than halved from 6.9% in July 2023 to 3.3% in July 2024. Services inflation has been stickier still. It was at 5.2% in July. It has fallen steadily from 6.5% pace in January. The slower growth of wages is expected to slow services inflation. Last week, the UK reported a 4.0% rise in average weekly earnings (three months, year-over-year), the slowest since late 2020. At the end of next week, August retail sales will be reported. On a volume basis, UK retail sales (including gasoline) have risen by an average of 0.6% a month. However, consumption is a much larger category and although the UK economy was the fastest growing among the G7 in H1 24, consumption looks like it may have been a drag, but it is expected to be improving this quarter, even as overall economic activity decelerates from 0.6% quarter-over-quarter in Q2 and 0.7% in Q1 24.\\nSterling\\'s pullback in the first part of last week took it to almost $1.30. This surpassed the (38.2%) retracement of the August rally but stopped short of the next retracement (50%), which is near $1.2965. Sterling benefitted from the broad pullback in the US dollar amid the speculation of a half-point cut by the Fed. It rose above $1.3150 ahead of the weekend, which itself was a retracement target of the losses sterling suffered after the US jobs data on September 6. Sterling was turned back from them and recorded the session low near $1.3115 before consolidating. We are not convinced that the bounce is the beginning of a new leg up. We suspect sterling will retest the lows near $1.30 before last month\\'s high (~$1.3265). Still, nearby resistance is seen in the $1.3165. Eurozone:\\nAfter last week\\'s ECB rate cut and somber forecasts, this week\\'s high-frequency data is unlikely to materially impact expectations for next month\\'s ECB meeting. There was almost a 45% chance of an October cut discounted at the end of last week. The euro closed slightly higher on the week, and it was the sixth weekly gain in the past seven weeks, but it did not reflect good news from the eurozone. Growth in Q2 was revised to 0.2% from 0.3%, and the Germany engine is still not firing. The industry is still hobbled, as illustrated by Volkswagen\\'s woes. German industrial production tumbled 2.4% in July (month-over-month). Its manufacturing PMI fell for three months through August to 42.4 (43.3 last December). The September ZEW survey results will be reported on September 17. After 11 consecutive months of improvement, the expectations component fell in July and August, and at 19.2 in August, it was the lowest level since January. The assessment of current conditions has moved around a bit but at -77.3 in August, it is essentially flat since the end of last year (-77.1 in December 2023). News that Germany\\'s trade surplus unexpectedly dropped by a third in the two months through July is likely to exert a drag on the EMU trade balance due September 16.\\nThe driver of the euro\\'s exchange rate is likely to continue to be found in US developments rather than Europe. The US two-year yield has fallen considerably faster than the Germany yield, and the US premium has sunk to about 135 bp from the year\\'s high near 205 bp in mid-April. It had risen to 150 bp in the middle of last week, after the US CPI, before taking another leg down on the renewed speculation of a 50 bp cut by the Fed. Last year, it bottomed near 112 bp and seems a reasonable medium-term target. After $1.10 held on September 11 (50% retracement of the August rally is about $1.0990), the euro rallied slightly above $1.11 to set a new high for the week ahead of the weekend. The downtrend connecting the late August and early September highs is around $1.1125 to start the new week. The high around the US jobs data was $1.1155 and the year\\'s high set in late August was slightly above $1.12. China:\\nThe Federal Reserve\\'s rate cut and clear signal that more will be forthcoming may remove an obstacle to easing by the PBOC. In a broad dollar decline, the yuan rose to its best levels of the year. It had gotten sufficiently strong that the newswires were reporting that state-owned banks were buying dollars. The dollar recovered in the first half of last week before selling off to a four-day low before the weekend. Banks set prime rates this week, but they seem to be waiting for the PBOC to move first. How the state-owned banks relate to the state is debatable. The dominant view seems to be that when these banks operate in the foreign exchange or bond market, they are doing the bidding of the government. Yet, at the same time, those same banks have resisted pressure from Beijing to lend to property developers and to refrain from buying government bonds. If those banks bought dollars, as press reports suggest, after selling them above CNY7.25 in July, who realizes the profit? Meanwhile, since mid-May, China\\'s CSI 300 has rallied in only three weeks and is off 5% in the past two weeks. It is back to levels seen in February, which itself as the low since early 2019. Although Chinese officials closely managed the yuan\\'s exchange rate, it is continuing to track the yen. The yen\\'s gains helped the offshore yuan string together a three-day advance. The dollar settled virtually unchanged on the week--slightly higher against the offshore yuan and slightly lower against the onshore yuan. Canada:\\nBarring a new shock, the Bank of Canada is set to cut rates at the last two meetings of the year (Oct 23 and Dec 11), and this will likely be underscored by the record of the recent central bank meeting. In fact, this week\\'s CPI coupled with the greater confidence in the Fed\\'s easing cycle, could boost the chances of a 50 bp move, especially after the dismal jobs report (which saw a nearly 44k loss of full-time jobs and a jump in unemployment to 6.6% from 6.4%). Bank of Canada Governor Macklem kept the door open to this possibility last week. Consumer inflation continues to moderate. A 0.1% rise in August consumer prices will allow the year-over-year rate to fall to 2.1% from 2.5%. The three-month annualized rate would be about 1.6%. The underlying core measures are also expected to have fallen. Other data will be less impactful. Canada will report July retail sales and a bounce back after a 0.3% drop in June is expected. Portfolio flows for July will be released on September 18. In Q2, foreign investors net purchased C$67 bln of Canada\\'s bonds and stocks. This is the most in a three-month period in a couple of years. The Toronto Stock Exchange Composite rallied nearly 5.7% in July, its best month of the year, and its second-best since November 2020 (and another 1% last month). The 10-year yield fell by 35 bp, more than the previous two months combined.\\nThe US dollar extended its recovery against the Canadian dollar after a slide in August but stopped shy of the (38.2%) retracement objective near CAD1.3635. It pulled back in recent sessions but was limited to the CAD1.3565 area, which itself is a retracement target of the greenback\\'s rally since the low from September 6 jobs report day. The greenback finished slightly firmer on the week for the second consecutive week, after a four-week slide. The momentum indicators are still constructive. Barring a break of the CAD1.3550 area, we anticipate a retest on the CAD1.3625-50 area. Australia:\\nAustralia\\'s August jobs report is the only data of note in the coming week (September 19). It may help the central bank persuade more investors that rates are unlikely to be cut soon. Despite the firm pushback against market speculation, the futures market continues to discount around an 80% chance of a cut by the end of the year. Through July, Australia has created almost 320k jobs (273 full-time posts) compared with 245k jobs (168k full-time) in the first seven months of 2023. Still, the unemployment rate has gradually risen to 4.2% from 3.9% at the end of last year. What is happening is the participation rate has risen from 66.6% at the end of 2023 to 67.1% in July. Migration has boosted Australia\\'s population. The Australian dollar initially extended its pullback from the $0.6825 high set in late August and fell to almost $0.6620 in the middle of last week, just above the 200-day moving average. The broad setback to the US dollar saw it recover to nearly $0.6735 before the weekend. Overcoming resistance in the $0.6750-$0.6770 area could re-target the high. However, we are not convinced that the uptrend has, in fact, resumed. Mexico:\\nMexico reported softer than expected CPI. The headline rate slipped to 4.99% from 5.57% in July. It was the first decline since February. Mexico\\'s CPI bottomed last October (4.26%). The July print was the highest since May 2023. The core rate eased to 4.0% from 4.05%. It has fallen every month since January 2023, when it was at 8.45%. It has not been below 4% since February 2021. The central bank meets on September 26. Banxico cut rates in August, and the risks have increased of another cut in September. Recall that in August, it cut this year\\'s growth forecast to 1.5% from 2.4%. The dollar settled above MXN20.00 on September 10 for the first time in two years. It looks set to move higher but posted a bearish reversal the next day by trading on both sides of the September 10 range and settled below its low. Follow-through selling before the weekend sent the greenback to nearly MXN19.19, where the (61.8%) retracement of the dollar\\'s last leg up that began in mid-August is found. A break of that area could see MXN19.00. Given the carry (interest rate differential), it is expensive for short-term momentum and trend followers to be short without robust momentum. The controversial judicial reform was approved by both chambers of Congress and states and in the coming days, the bill regarding the National Guard will be taken up.\\nOriginal Post\\nEditor\\'s Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Nearby was a large pile of logs. 'It's a pretty neanderthal arrangement,' she explained. 'When the power shuts off we feed the stove with wood. In winter we do this round the clock. Our plants require constant temperatures. They don't like cold and hot.'\\nInside the glass nursery were dozens of rare specimens. All were bromeliads native to the Americas. Silvery wisps of beard-like Tillandsia descended from a pipe. A pineapple poked out of a stem. A screen next to the stove protected a group of starfish-like earth stars, native to Brazil. The collection needed a minimum temperature of 10C, Yaroslavska – a senior researcher – said. Below that everything would die off.\\nThe greenhouse is one of eight in the Mykola Hryshko national botanical garden in Kyiv. Founded in 1935, it is Ukraine's biggest garden and one of the largest in Europe. It is home to about 13,000 species of trees, flowers and other plants from around the world. The 52-hectare (130 acres) site has scientific departments and two laboratories. With its roses and camellias, it is a popular venue with wedding photographers.\\nBut the park is now staring at disaster. In recent months, Russia has systematically destroyed most of Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Power cuts in the capital and across the country are common, with the situation getting worse. The city authorities have said they will not be able to guarantee supply in the freezing months ahead. Prices for electricity have doubled, as the garden's funding has shrunk.\\n'Worst-case scenario is we lose a big part of our collection,' Roman Ivannikov, the head of the tropical and subtropical plant department, said. Money is so tight he and his colleagues recently took a pay cut. Last winter, £55,000 in donations kept the garden going, allowing the purchase of 242 tonnes of fuel pellets. Volunteers chopped firewood. The garden is appealing for help, under the hashtag #greenhousewarming.\\nBefore the first chilly night of October arrives, Ivannikov said his team urgently needed additional generators. The orchid house had a unique collection of exotic specimens and was especially vulnerable. Last year, three Samsung heat pumps were fitted to maintain temperatures at 20-22C. But there was no back-up in the case of a prolonged shutdown.\\nIvannikov pointed out some of the collection's highlights. They included an egg-in-the-nest orchid from China – it has a strange white-and-purple-spotted flower – and a delicate green jewel orchid. Another example – Doritis pulcherrima – was descended from a plant sent into space in 1986. The orchid was part of a Soviet mission to the Mir space station, where the crew performed experiments in biology.\\nThe garden collaborates with international partners. In 2014, it sent plants to Vietnam, after their original habitat was destroyed to make way for banana and coffee crops. 'I travelled with 45 orchids,' Ivannikov recalled. 'I watched on TV, as Russia took Crimea.' Scientific conferences with Moscow stopped. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion Ivannikov took his family out of Kyiv and returned a week later.\\nThe Kremlin continues to fire missiles at the capital. From time to time, falling debris breaks glass in the hothouses. Blast waves from explosions have dislodged a chunk of wall and knocked over red-listed plants. 'We haven't had a direct hit. But we suffered a lot of damage,' Ivannikov said. In January, a rocket flew above the main orangery, a giant glass dome containing banks of shaggy vines and a towering king palm.\\nIryna Yudakova, an engineer, was inside. 'I didn't hear the air alarm. I went out and saw a streak in the sky,' she said. 'There was an explosion. A piece of shrapnel fell next to me. Another hit a window. I was lucky.' Yudakova said she enjoyed her job but that the pay – 8,000 hryvnia a month (£150) – was measly. 'Previously I was a psychologist. When the war started I lost my clients. Without my husband I couldn't survive,' she said.\\nYudakova's duties include looking after the rhododendrons and azaleas. In February, one of her favourite plants – an old specimen bred in Germany in the 1930s – lost most of its leaves during a blackout. 'It got too cold,' she said. 'The younger, smaller plants survive better.' Standing next to the denuded shrub, she reflected: 'It's like losing a relative or a pet. I think of them as my kids. I water them, care for them, talk to them.'\\nMany employees have worked at the garden for decades. Others fled Russian occupation. Among them are a father and daughter in charge of the bonsai collection, who escaped from Mariupol. Ivannikov said his soldier cousin died defending the eastern city, which Russia flattened in 2022. About 1,000 volunteers do various tasks. They prune lavender, remove unwanted hops and water juvenile plants.\\n'It's gardening therapy. The volunteers do useful work. They go home feeling better,' Ivannikov said. Last weekend, dog walkers and young couples visited the alpine garden and sat in a pleasant outdoor cafe. A red squirrel bounded between trees. Next to the administration building – where new orchids are nurtured in glass flasks – a sale of succulents was going on. Proceeds went to Ukraine's armed forces.\\nBack at the bromeliad house Yaroslavska said she would like to replace the building – constructed in 1976 under communism – with a modern, more heat-efficient version. She recognised there was no point in making improvements while the war rumbled on and bombs fell randomly from the sky. For now, the objective was for the garden and its 4,000 tropical and subtropical plants to get through the coming winter.\\nThere were also smaller challenges, she said. A bold squirrel had climbed in through a ventilation window and made off with the figs from a rare tree. Apart from getting rid of the squirrel, what else did she want?

With Steves as tour guide, conductor John Morris Russell led the Pops through an engaging trip of 19th-century music from multiple European countries.\\nThe inimitable travel writer, entrepreneur and TV personality, known to millions for his PBS series and radio shows, was host and narrator for a program of romantic-era anthems, most of them greatest hits of music history. Steves provided some of the stories behind the music and how these nationalistic works inspired patriotism – and sometimes revolution -- in the populace.\\nIt was a polished and stirring package, and the orchestra's musicians performed wonderfully. Steves, a classically trained pianist, even took up the baton once to conduct them. There were many standing ovations and a polite Cincinnati 'mosh pit' in the lobby afterwards as fans assembled to get his autograph.\\nIn the hall were 18 cameras and a 26-foot jib swinging out over the audience, meaning that the Pops was once again in the business of TV specials. The show is being filmed live during all three concerts in partnership with CET, Cincinnati's public television station. In a few months, it will be made available to PBS stations to air across the country.\\nThe show was being filmed live during all three concerts in partnership with CET. In a few months, it will be made available to PBS stations to air across the country. JP Leong\\nSteves offered just enough information sprinkled with lots of humor to enhance the music we were about to hear. Wearing a suit and tie instead of his usual travel clothes and day pack, the host communicated with the same friendly and down-to-earth style that we've come to know over his career of more than 40 years. It was a show he has performed many times with orchestras, and he delivered it entirely from memory. On this night, there were no 'bloopers' – the take-outs that often appear at the ends of his PBS travel shows.\\nThe program opened with a mellow arrangement of 'America the Beautiful,' a celebration of our homeland. Steves and the Pops then traveled to Austria, with the 'Emperor Waltz' by Johann Strauss Jr., the 'No. 1 hit from 1889.' Next, it was up the Danube River to Bavaria, Germany, with an example of King Ludwig's favorite composer, Richard Wagner. Russell took a very brisk tempo in the Prelude to Act III of 'Lohengrin,' and the brass and horn sections played it thrillingly.\\nSmetana's 'The Moldau' was named for the longest river in the Czech Republic, the 'Vlatava,' and illustrates tone painting in music. Steves provided a road map to its picturesque landmarks, adding that the work embodies the enduring spirit of the Czech people, who have long struggled with 'big bully neighbors.' Finishing the first half, Elgar's Military March No. 1 from 'Pomp and Circumstance' was set in a new light when Steves told us it 'captures the grandeur of the world's first superpower under Queen Victoria.'\\nAfter intermission, Russell led a fresh and invigorating performance of Felix Mendelssohn's 'Italian' Symphony, the German composer's postcard of Italy. The Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi 'stirred national spirits like a bugle call,' especially in his opera, 'Nabucco.' Russell and the Pops delivered a stirring rendition of its Overture, taking care to express the beauty of 'Va, pensiero,' the haunting chorus of Hebrew slaves at its center.\\nThe tour bus next traveled to Spain via Russia for 'Alborada' by Rimsky Korsakov, followed by Manuel de Falla's 'Ritual Fire Dance.' The second half included an exuberant, brass-filled French military march by Camille Saint-Saëns, and an abridged arrangement of 'Ode to Joy' from Beethoven's Symphony No. 9. (Did you know that 'Ode to Joy' is the official anthem of the European Union?)\\nSteves added a personal note to Grieg's 'Morning Mood' from 'Peer Gynt,' his tribute to Norway, 'the land of my grandparents.' He added a sweet story about meeting his Norwegian Uncle Thor for the first time.\\nRick Steves addresses the audience as conductor John Morris Russell looks on. The Pops musicians sported new, updated red blazers created by Cincinnati company Sew Valley. JP Leong\\nThe evening ended when Steves surprised viewers by picking up Russell's baton for a rousing performance of Sousa's 'Stars and Stripes Forever.' The orchestra was in top form all evening as they performed these wonderful tunes.\\nSteves also was in top form, despite his announcement in August that he will undergo surgery in late September for prostate cancer. Steves, who lives in Washington, noted that he'd just been in Paris filming a gourmet barge trip through Burgundy, slated for a future PBS show.\\n'Normally I fly directly from Paris to Seattle, but I'm tickled to stop in Cincinnati,' he said.\\nAt intermission, he held a drawing for a free trip on one of his company's tours, won by a woman in Row F.\\nKicking off the new season, the Pops musicians sported new, updated red blazers created by Cincinnati company Sew Valley. And if you looked down at your feet in the lobby, you'd have seen newly restored flooring that is historic to the building, thanks to the Friends of Music Hall.\\nRick Steves' Europe: A Symphonic Journey repeats at 7:30 p.m. Sept. 14 and 2 p.m. Sept. 15 in Music Hall.

Matthew Rankin\\'s Universal Language is set in Winnipeg, but an alternate-universe version of the city, where Louis Riel is on the common currency and the official languages are French and Farsi.\\nThat leaves two other visions of Winnipeg on display at TIFF, which opened on Sept. 5 and wraps up Sunday. Each film offers a bold and distinctive view of the city.\\nThe Mother and the Bear, by Vancouver-based Chinese-Canadian filmmaker Johnny Ma, portrays a Winnipeg viewed through a beautiful fairy tale prism, through the story of a mother who comes to the city from Korea to check on her hospitalized daughter, rendered comatose after a spill on an icy sidewalk.\\nAberdeen, by extreme contrast, is a gritty drama about the title character, a woman whose terrible choices come back to haunt her as she navigates bars, hotel rooms, government offices and drug dens in a desperate effort to prevent her grandchildren from entering foster care.\\nThe Mother and the Bear represents an interesting melange: a magic-laced comedy fashioned by a Chinese-Canadian director with money from Canada and Chile, and featuring two Korean actors.\\nTopping it off: director Ma is based in Vancouver (and sometimes Mexico), so it seems especially peculiar that he would call The Mother and the Bear \"a love letter to Winnipeg.\"\\n\"The original story that I wrote, that was based on a real person that I met, was actually set in Cincinnati,\" Ma said during a small after-party following the film\\'s TIFF screening. \"So when I started working with Chileans, they brought me to the Canadian partner.\\n\"I thought that they were going to suggest Toronto, Calgary, Vancouver, and those cities, and I was thinking, \\'That\\'s not the story. It doesn\\'t work there.\\'\"\\nFortunately, one of the producers on the film was frequent Guy Maddin collaborator Niv Fichman.\\n\"And Niv said Winnipeg,\" Ma recalled. \"I was about to fight him on it. But then I said, \\'Wait, that is really interesting.\\'\\n\"As a Canadian filmmaker, I\\'ve always been fascinated by Winnipeg filmmakers,\" Ma said. \"Their art is so different than anything else that you can ever see in Canada or the world.\"\\nSo he decided to \"make it an adventure.\"\\n\"I took this as an opportunity to learn about Winnipeg, and what I learned about it is that there is a kindness in the cold,\" Ma said.\\nHe had good teachers. He spoke with Maddin (who has a brief cameo as a dog-walker).\\n\"He is the godfather of the Winnipeg cinema for every one of us,\" Ma said. \"I wanted him to be in the film in spirit.\"\\nMaddin\\'s Rumours co-directors, the Johnson brothers, were also producers on the film.\\nAnother filmmaker, Mike Maryniuk, \"was, to me, my Winnipeg whisperer,\" Ma said.\\nWhile some of the visiting actors were startled by the cold of a winter shoot, Ma found it soothing.\\n\"The winter is the time when you go within yourself in some weird way,\" Ma said. \"I lost my father two years ago during the pandemic, so [when] I went to Winnipeg, it nurtured me.\\n\"It was the most creative I\\'ve ever felt in Canada,\" he said. \"So to me, the movie became a thank-you letter back to Winnipeg.\"\\nAberdeen, a hard-hitting drama, offers a far different view of the city.\\nIt follows a woman (Gail Maurice from Night Raiders) from Peguis First Nation in southern Manitoba literally fighting to reclaim her identity after losing her ID. Occasionally sheltered from the abuses of the system by her two-spirit friend Alfred (Billy Merasty), she struggles to reconnect with her dying brother (Ryan Rajendra Black) and her own drug-addicted daughter.\\nThe story is a personal one for writer-director Ryan Cooper, who is himself from Peguis First Nation and a graduate of the National Screen Institute\\'s CBC New Indigenous Voices program.\\nHe got help to realize it from co-director Eva Thomas, a member of Walpole Island First Nation in southwestern Ontario, who worked on Aberdeen between series gigs on Manitoba-filmed shows Acting Good and Don\\'t Even.\\nThe decision to co-direct was Thomas\\'s.\\n\"Ryan sent me the script, and I read it, I loved it,\" Thomas said. \"And I sent him notes and he thought they were helpful.\"\\nCooper asked Thomas if she would direct the film herself.\\n\"She said, \\'No, but I will direct it with you,\\'\" said Cooper.\\nThomas said it was important to her that Cooper be involved as a director, \"because it\\'s such a personal story to him.\"\\nBoth have been to TIFF before — Thomas premiered her short film Redlights at the festival last year — but say they\\'re thrilled to have their first feature at the festival.\\n\"It\\'s been wonderful. It\\'s a dream come true,\" says Cooper. \"I always came as part of a delegation, but never as a director-writer.\"\\nWhile it\\'s a tough film, Thomas says audiences at the premiere screening were engaged.\\n\"We got a standing ovation, which is really nice,\" Thomas said. \"And there were a lot of questions after the screening. People want to talk to you until they were pushed out. In the lobby, people were still coming up and talking to us.\"\\nShe laughed as he recalled finding no refuge in the washroom.\\n\"I was there for another 20 minutes,\" she said.\\nThomas said encountering homeless people in Winnipeg galvanized her in the effort to get the film made.\\n\"That\\'s my driving force with Aberdeen. How do we create empathy and compassion for a person like Aberdeen?\" Thomas said.\\n\"People can go on a journey with her, and even though she starts off difficult and unlikable and challenging, you can understand,\" Thomas said. \"Those aren\\'t character flaws. She\\'s a product of her trauma.\"\\nCooper said it feels like the film is \"giving voice to the voiceless.\"\\n\"They don\\'t understand where this trauma comes from.

He has now committed to review every kebab shop in New South Wales, in an attempt to prove how far-reaching and consistent – not to mention delicious – the stores are.\\nSign up for Guardian Australia's breaking news email\\nHe estimates there are more than 2,000 kebab shops across the state, and by Thursday had reached 38 of them. At his current pace, he estimates he would need 6.5 years to reach them all.\\n'I wanted to show people that we are a quiet giant in the hospitality industry, I wanted to show people that there are more kebab shops here than there are any other major chain,' Sahin tells Guardian Australia.\\n'And I want to show how important we are to the food scene in this state.'\\nSahin wants to prove that the Sydney-style of kebab is more than just a late-night gimmick or an oily mess – but a food staple across the state.\\nHe's also opened the door to a conversation about the Australian-Turkish community's unique place among the many migrant communities in the country.\\n'Our Sydney kebab, it's a classic, it's so simple. Doner meat is wrapped in Lebanese bread or Greek pita. And then you have lettuce, tomato, onion, sometimes tabouli, and sauces like barbecue, garlic or chilli,' explains Sahin.\\n'A Berlin-style kebab usually comes in much thicker bread, almost like a burger,' he says. 'And they add things like pickled cabbage, they have a specific spicy sauce, it's just different.'\\nBoth styles represent the journeys of their respective Turkish diasporas, an example of diverging styles and tastes, changed by the act of migration itself.\\nThe doner kebab was brought to Australia by Turkish migrants, who began opening shops as early as the 1980s. And while there is little conclusive data, the community does claim to own a majority of kebab shops around the country.\\nSahin says that the Sydney-style kebab is heavily influenced by other migrant communities in Australia, whether through the use of Lebanese bread and tabouli, or through condiments like barbecue sauce.\\n'Our kebab here is a concoction of all these cultures coming together in Australia. And the kebab is 100% a multicultural cuisine, it takes from everyone around it.\\n'This style of kebab is iconic, it's unique in the world, and is a trusted food in Australia. You can't get something like that in Turkey, or from other diasporas.'\\nThe 'Berlin-style' kebab was developed in Germany in 1972, and is also an adaptation of a Turkish doner kebab, differing significantly again to what is offered in Turkey today – which usually includes less vegetables or sauce.\\nTurkish immigrants to West Berlin in the 1970s popularised the sandwich, which has become a staple of Berlin's street-food culture.\\nAnd just like in Australia, they took slices of the culture around them to formulate something unique to their new home.\\nThe earliest known Turkish migrants arrived in Australia as part of the cameleers that serviced South Australia's pastoral industry between 1860 and 1900, with numbers picking up in the late 60s, growing to nearly 19,000 by 1974.\\nAround this time, a man named Muammer Tüysüz arrived in Australia with his family and only US$20 in his pocket.\\nSign up to Afternoon Update\\nOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters\\nafter newsletter promotion\\nTüysüz had worked in catering for the Turkish prime minister, and around 1974 attended a wedding in Australia that served doner kebabs. This got him thinking, and two years later, he imported his own machines and began operating a mobile kebab shop out the back of his station wagon.\\nHis daughter, Melek Tüysüz, says this made him the first person to sell kebabs in Australia.\\n'He operated out of old Chinatown in Haymarket, in Sydney. It grew so popular, he then turned it into a truck that operated out of Flemington Markets weekly.'\\nSoon after, Tüysüz began operating at events like the Easter Show, where the sandwich exploded in popularity, and his business expanded rapidly.\\n'I remember people just standing and watching the cooking process, and asking what it was, and how it worked? They would just stand and stare.'\\nAdvertised at the time as a 'meal in a wrap', it began first as just meat, lettuce, tomato and onion, with no sauce. Melek said sauce was only added later.\\nTüysüz won various awards for his food, winning 'best food outlet' at the Sydney Easter Show for four consecutive years in the early 1990s. He would go on to cater at major events such as the Sydney Olympics, AFL and NRL matches and music festivals.\\nMelek pauses as she goes through old photos of her father standing proudly outside his food truck in the 1980s.\\n'This generation of migrants, these people that came to this country with nothing in their pockets, they built the communities we have now,'' she says.\\n'He had limited English, but he was never shy. He made this out of nothing, and changed the landscape of Australian cuisine, almost by himself. Maybe people don't remember, but I remember.'\\nDr Lutfiye Ali, a lecturer in Community Psychology at Victoria University, says opening a kebab shop was often the easiest way for migrants with limited English – and whose skills weren't recognised in Australia – to make money.\\nShe says the 'dream of a better life was shaped by racism in that economic opportunities and employment were limited for some migrants, so they capitalised on their skills to produce and to contribute to the social fabric around them'.\\n'This is about migrants and their struggle for survival.'\\nAli says the proliferation of kebab shops represented a search for safety, comfort and financial stability for the migrant generation who were establishing themselves for the benefits of the next generation.\\nShe said the unique qualities of the Sydney-style kebab reflected this survival instinct, reshaping their traditions to the tastes of a new market.\\n'They needed to make adjustments, but they've kept the essence of it.'\\n'In many ways, these cultural expressions are a response to marginalisation.

'Some patients may abuse that trust'.\\nThere's also a gender divide, with 52 per cent of women experiencing sexual harassment compared with 34 per cent of men, according to the analysis.\\n'From the male patient to the female doctor, it's, quote, traditional sexism, or being against the idea of a female doctor,' Kamau-Mitchell said.\\n'But from the female patient to the male doctor, it's a different type of sexism, of thinking that somehow males should tolerate this kind of behaviour, which is ridiculous'.\\nWhile most countries don't report official statistics on sexual harassment of health care workers, some of the most comprehensive data comes from the UK. In a 2021 survey of about 1,800 UK doctors, 31.8 per cent said they had received unwanted, gender-related comments that caused 'embarrassment, distress, or offence' within the past two years.\\nMeanwhile, between 2017 and 2022, National Health Service (NHS) workers reported nearly 21,000 cases of rape, sexual assault, harassment, stalking, and abusive comments by patients, though few units had processes in place to combat these problems, according to an investigation published last year.\\nThose figures underscore that sexual harassment is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to aggression from patients. They also show that doctors aren't the only health workers at risk – nurses, trainees, and other staffers all face unwanted attention and threats.\\nFor example, Umut Can Öztürk, a medical student in Turkey and a leader in the European Medical Students' Association (EMSA), told Euronews Health that his female colleagues try to dress conservatively to avoid being leered at by patients.\\nPaul de Raeve, a longtime nurse and secretary general of the European Federation of Nursing Associations, said he typically tried to get someone else in the room if he felt patients were making suggestive comments.\\nHe said aggression toward nurses – including sexual harassment, physical and verbal attacks – has only escalated in recent years, with a profound effect on health workers' satisfaction at work.\\n'COVID-19 has aggravated this situation,' de Raeve told Euronews Health. 'We are going to lose our nurses … because they said, 'enough is enough'''.\\nThe issue also remains heavily stigmatised, and many health care workers don't report these incidents because they don't believe anything will be done to remedy the situation, de Raeve, Villanueva, and Kamau-Mitchell all said.\\n'If you're a busy doctor and you're subject to this, and you're under such pressure that you don't even have time to report it or think much about it, you just trod on,' Villanueva said.\\n'But that ultimately affects your mental health and makes you more prone to things like anxiety or depression'.\\nWhile some countries, such as Spain and the Czech Republic, have national registries to monitor violence against healthcare workers, sexual harassment often falls into a grey area.\\n'There's no day that we don't have a patient yelling or screaming or sometimes hitting health care professionals,' Villanueva said. 'But sexual harassment is something much more subtle'.\\nMedical groups across Europe are pushing for a more comprehensive accounting of these incidents. They plan to circulate a standardised questionnaire among physicians, medical students, and other health workers that asks about physical and verbal abuse, including sexual harassment.\\nRegardless of the data, Villanueva said that health systems should make it easier to expel people from a physician's patient list, so they don't have to see someone who has harassed them again.\\nKamau-Mitchell wants hospitals to install panic alarms that allow staff to quickly call for help, and for doctors to be able to wear body cameras that record patient interactions – an option the UK's ambulance crews already have – though she acknowledges that patient privacy and data storage would be challenges.\\nMedical students told Euronews Health that training on how to handle sexual harassment, including where to report it, is currently missing from school curricula. They'd like to see it prioritised more, but said their own instructors may first need to be trained.\\n'Although we are told about how to recognise harassment or violence cases, we are not specifically told about how to act when we face violence as doctors in positions in hospitals or in clinics,' Duygu İleri, a medical student in Turkey and EMSA's ethics and human rights lead, told Euronews Health.\\nUltimately, the experts said it will likely take a combination of government, health system, and social changes to protect doctors and other medical personnel against sexual harassment and other forms of aggression.\\nDoctors 'know these problems exist,' Kamau-Mitchell said, but 'unfortunately, they don't have the power to change these sorts of things'.\\n'We need to realise that we can't just leave people to deal with problems on their own, because they, unfortunately, then become very psychologically burdened, and that isn't great for us as a society'.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

GOP attacks are the latest example.', 'topic': 'news', 'country': 'US'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text=\"This past week, Republicans amplified a barrage of strange and racist claims about Haitian immigrants, including falsely suggesting that they're consuming people's house pets.\\nThe unfounded attacks came from official party social media accounts, lawmakers, and from both members of the GOP's presidential ticket. Vice presidential candidate JD Vance said Monday that 'Haitian illegal immigrants' are 'causing chaos,' while former President Donald Trump emphatically, and falsely, claimed during his Tuesday debate with Vice President Kamala Harris that, 'they're eating the pets of the people that live there, and this is what's happening in our country.'\\nThe comments echo well-worn tropes, and past attempts to tie Haitian immigrants to everything from the spread of illness to upticks in crime.\\nRepublicans have elevated these messages as they seek to make immigration a flashpoint in the November election, capitalizing on voters' dissatisfaction with current trends. The attacks also come as rampant political instability and gang violence in Haiti has displaced thousands of people — and as the Biden administration has approved temporary protections and humanitarian parole for some new arrivals.\\nThe stereotypes the GOP is harping on, however, have been around for much longer.\\nIn fact, as experts tell Vox, these types of ugly attacks are the byproduct of centuries of anti-Black racism and xenophobic sentiment, which have been used over and over to justify restrictive immigration policies that single out Haitian people. The decision to resurface them in 2024 is, once again, creating a palpably dangerous environment, and adding to this legacy.\\n'It's a part of a very old historic pattern,' Regine Jackson, a sociologist and the Dean of Humanities at Morehouse College, told Vox. 'It's the idea that they could do something so inhuman, so un-American. That's the message underneath, that these people will never be like us.'\\nAttacks on Haitian immigrants tap into the longstanding US framing of Haiti as a threat.\\n'Racism and xenophobia against Haitians among white Americans can be traced all the way back to the Haitian Revolution when Haitians … [overthrew] the system of slavery and [established] the world's first Black republic,' Carl Lindskoog, the author of a book on the US's detention of Haitian immigrants, told Vox. 'Since then, Haitians have been seen by many white Americans as a threat to white rule and have been treated as such.'\\nIn 1804, Haitians successfully overthrew colonial rule and enslavement by France. Concerned that Haitians' victory would inspire enslaved people in America to pursue a similar revolution, the US did not recognize Haiti's independence for nearly six decades.\\nFollowing the revolution, France used military force to demand financial restitution for loss of the colony, forcing Haiti to borrow money to cover its demands. The US and France provided those loans — and used them to continue exerting control over Haiti's finances for years. In total, a New York Times investigation found that reparations to France cost Haiti's economy $21 billion and directly contributed to poverty and financial problems that still plague the country to this day.\\nThe US also occupied Haiti by force from 1915 to 1934, more than a century after its successful revolution, under the flimsy justification that it was there to ensure political stability following the assassination of multiple Haitian presidents. In reality, it mounted the occupation to prevent France or Germany from gaining ground in the region, which was viewed as strategically valuable. During this time, the US set up a system of forced labor, and sold Haitian land to American corporations.\\nThe takeover also sent a demeaning message: that Haiti wasn't capable of handling its own affairs.\\n'A lot of scholars have talked about … rhetoric that's used to justify invasion around civilizing a society,' says Jamella Gow, a sociologist at Bowdoin University. 'This notion of Haitians as backwards, criminal and dangerous started way back then.' The association of Haiti with voodoo practices, something self-help author Marianne Williamson, who ran in the Democratic presidential primary in 2020 and 2024, evoked this week, is another tactic that's been used to suggest that they're a 'mysterious … migrant other,' says Gow.\\nIn the decades since, the US's treatment of Haitian immigrants has built on and reinforced these ideas. That was evident in the 1970s, when a wave of Haitian migrants sought asylum in the US as they tried to escape political persecution from US-backed dictator Jean Claude Duvalier. Many of these arrivals were detained and denied asylum, though they met the qualifications for it.\\nThese practices set a precedent for the detention of asylum-seekers, a punitive approach the US still employs now. In a 1980 Haitian Refugee Center v. Civiletti case, the Fifth Circuit ruled that the US government had singled Haitians out and practiced blatant racism in its immigration policies. Despite this decision, then-President Jimmy Carter and his successors managed to find loopholes to keep up this approach. In the years that followed, while a surge of Cuban and Haitian migrants came to the US around the same time, Haitian people were far more likely to stay in detention compared to their Cuban counterparts.\\nThe stigmatization of Haitian immigrants continued, too, in subsequent decades, including efforts to associate Haitians with illnesses, such as HIV. In the early 1980s, when no scientific name had been given to HIV/AIDS, the press and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention deemed it the 4H disease — which stood for 'Haitians, Homosexuals, Hemophiliacs, and Heroin users,' in part because some of the early cases of the illness included Haitian people.\\nA fear of HIV — and the framing of Haitian immigrants as carriers of disease — was among the reasons that led the US to detain Haitian asylum seekers at Guantanamo Bay during the 1990s. (Thousands were detained and deported, while some who were HIV-positive were threatened with indefinite detention.) That's part of a long history of the US government deeming immigrants health hazards in order to stymie their entry into the country — a practice that was again embraced during the Covid-19 pandemic.\\nBoth the Trump and Biden administrations used a federal authority known as Title 42 to turn away migrants due to public health concerns during and following pandemic. Haitians were one of the largest groups turned away at the southern border on these grounds, Lindsvoog said.\\nOther attacks on Haitians were also evident in both administrations, such as when Trump himself referred to Haiti as a 'shithole' country, and when border patrol officers were captured riding on horses and using their reins to confront Haitian immigrants under Biden.\\nIn the town of Springfield, Ohio, the latest GOP invective is already doing real-world harm.\\nOn Tuesday, Trump gave the conspiracy its largest platform yet, and since then, the claims about the immigrants, which have been repeatedly debunked, have only spread.\\nIn the wake of all this, Haitian immigrants in Springfield — the town in which the GOP claims the pet eating is taking place — have experienced property damage and are keeping their children home from school out of concerns for safety, the Haitian Times reports.\\nSpringfield's city hall was also evacuated on Thursday in response to a bomb threat, and two elementary schools were evacuated on Friday due to concerns about public safety. The municipality's mayor has said he believes both incidents are tied to the claims that have been made about Haitian migrants.\\nSpringfield, a town of roughly 60,000 people in the southwestern part of the state, has found itself in Republican crosshairs due to the changes it's seen since 2020. About 15,000 Haitian people have moved to Springfield for jobs following a manufacturing boom there, and while the growth in population has helped rejuvenate the town, it's also put pressure on social services in the form of longer wait times at medical clinics and more competition for affordable housing, fueling some animosity toward the newcomers.\\nThat anger only intensified in 2023, following a school bus accident that killed 11-year-old Aiden Clark, since the driver of the car involved was a Haitian immigrant. Republicans and right-wing figures have since invoked Clark's death to highlight the threat immigrants pose — something his parents have begged them to stop doing.\\nThis hostility toward Haitian immigrants has resulted in neo-Nazis and Republican lawmakers spreading lies about immigrants eating not just pets, but also ducks from the local parks. There is no evidence of this, Springfield officials have said. One instance of a woman — neither an immigrant nor of Haitian descent — eating a cat took place in Canton, Ohio, which is many miles away.\\nTropes about people eating pets aren't new, and have long been used to demonize immigrant communities in the US, including Asian immigrants. Such stereotypes allow Republicans to paint immigrants, including Haitian people, as 'forever foreigners' in a bid to ostracize them. The focus on pets, in particular, is designed to undercut immigrants' humanity, and to suggest that they could harm something people hold dear, says Jackson.\\n'This kind of language, this kind of disinformation, is dangerous because there will be people that believe it, no matter how ludicrous and stupid it is, and they might act on that kind of information and act on it in a way where somebody could get hurt. So it needs to stop,' White House spokesperson John Kirby said at a press briefing Tuesday.\\nVance downplayed these concerns after Tuesday's presidential debate when he was asked about his comments by NBC's Yamiche Alcindor. 'What do I think is a bigger problem? Insulting 20,000 people or the fact that my constituents can't live a good life because Kamala Harris opened the border?' Vance said.\\nAs US history — and the threats Springfield faced this week — makes clear, however, these racist ideas can have a direct influence on policies, and lead to immediate, and dire, consequences.\\nYou've read 1 article in the last month\\nHere at Vox, we believe in helping everyone understand our complicated world, so that we can all help to shape it.

Is this a good time for Tottenham to face Arsenal?\\nHarris: Spurs will be smelling blood when they look at the number of key players unavailable to Mikel Arteta. Ange Postecoglou has also been dealing with injury issues, but if Dominic Solanke and Micky van de Ven are fully fit, he can field his strongest XI.\\nWhen these two sides faced each other in April, Ben Davies — deputising for the injured Destiny Udogie — could not keep up with Bukayo Saka. Udogie is fit again after spending the summer recovering from thigh surgery and his battle with Saka should be more even. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg scored an own goal in that game but has since left for Marseille and Postecoglou has a wider variety of options in central midfield.\\nThe biggest concern for Tottenham is that they can still look vulnerable at the back. Cristian Romero has made a couple of costly errors, which is somewhat understandable when you consider he only spent a couple of weeks on holiday after winning the Copa America with Argentina before returning for pre-season. Romero could have done with a rest during the international break but he played twice for Argentina. Tottenham fans will be hoping the extra game time has boosted his sharpness and that it does not leave him feeling knackered.\\nCarey: It is a cliche but it's true — all rules go out of the window in derby games. The quick turnaround after the international break might mean that the contest is a little lower in intensity, but this one is difficult to predict.\\nFor Arsenal, it is not just the blow of — as seems very likely — losing Martin Odegaard's quality to injury but also how much it affects them tactically. Arsenal's captain is a key component of their right-sided rotations with Ben White and Saka — a trio who have been so consistent for the past 18 months. They have plenty of quality elsewhere across the pitch, but add in Declan Rice's suspension and Arsenal fans' concerns become understandable.\\nSpurs have not made the blistering start of last season but have played well. On another day, they would have comfortably dispatched Leicester City and Newcastle United with the chances they generated and we all know that the football xG gods have a way of balancing things out across a season.\\nMight we see Spurs create fewer chances but score two scruffy goals? You wouldn't bet against it.\\nGO DEEPER\\nThree games in is too early to trust the Premier League table... or is it?\\nCampbell: Considering Arsenal's missing players, yes, they are weaker, but that need to capitalise brings its own pressure for Spurs.\\nArteta signing a new three-year contract, however, should re-energise Arsenal and balance out any pessimism.\\nIt is a statement of intent that says Arsenal are not content with being challengers. They want more and a win at Spurs would be the perfect way to show they are not going anywhere. Want all the latest Arsenal news, analysis and additional insight from James McNicholas, Amy Lawrence, David Ornstein, Art de Roche, Jordan Campbell and more? Join our new Arsenal WhatsApp channel Are we in for another exciting derby?\\nHarris: This fixture always produces drama. Postecoglou's philosophy is all about dominating the ball and pressuring the other team high up the pitch. When it works, as in their 4-0 victory over Everton last month, Tottenham do not let their opponents breathe and they score goals for fun.\\nThe style of play comes with a lot of risk. Spurs push so many players forward that they leave themselves vulnerable to counter-attacks. Saka's goal in Arsenal's 3-2 victory at the end of last season is a prime example of this. As can be seen below, Spurs dominated possession and territory but Arsenal took their chances.\\nHarry Kane is no longer at Spurs but Son Heung-min remains a threat. The speed of Brennan Johnson and Wilson Odobert will cause problems for Arsenal's full-backs, too. Solanke will make his home debut if he recovers from an ankle injury and scoring would be the perfect way to mark it.\\nCampbell: Arsenal were relentlessly efficient in the 3-2 win last season, making the most of their dominance from dead-ball situations.\\nBut in last season's first meeting, the enduring issue of playing well but spurning big chances prevented them from killing off the game early. Gabriel Jesus was most guilty and with the Brazilian potentially filling in for Kai Havertz up front, the question of whether Arsenal have enough killer instinct hangs over them.\\nTransitions will be key again for both teams and a first start for Raheem Sterling could help Arsenal add that extra incisiveness. Goals seem inevitable but do not be surprised to see Arteta employ a slightly more restrained, counter-attacking approach to compensate for the absence of Rice and Odegaard. How might Arsenal's midfield injuries affect things?\\nCampbell: Arsenal will probably be without what Arteta intended to be his first-choice midfield this season, with Mikel Merino and Odegaard both injured and Rice suspended.\\nThe sale of Emile Smith Rowe and the loan exit of Fabio Vieira means Arsenal cannot replicate the balance they would usually have.\\nHavertz dropping into midfield, with Jesus taking his place up front, is a natural solution to the left-sided central-midfielder gap, but Jorginho and Thomas Partey are the only other senior conventional midfielders available. Partey being pushed forward slightly to allow the Italian to play at No 6 is one option, as is tweaking the shape to employ a double pivot, but both players can leave Arsenal lacking mobility and creativity.\\nDropping Leandro Trossard back to play alongside Havertz would be an aggressive move but would risk leaving Arsenal too open. Shifting either Oleksandr Zinchenko or Jurrien Timber forward into midfield could help Arteta maximise continuity in their build-up play.\\nThe closest thing to a like-for-like Odegaard replacement is 17-year-old Ethan Nwaneri. It would be his first senior start but he could help Arsenal maintain their balance. Using an inexperienced teenager would also be the strongest rebuttal Arteta could serve to those sceptical of his willingness to trust academy players.\\nGO DEEPER\\nHow do Arsenal adapt if they are missing Odegaard and other first-choice midfielders?\\nHarris: James Maddison is the only midfielder to have started all of Tottenham's games this season. The 27-year-old has been accompanied by a rotating cast of Rodrigo Bentancur, Yves Bissouma, Pape Matar Sarr or Dejan Kulusevski, depending on the quality of the opposition.\\nIn the second half of their 2-1 defeat by Newcastle, Spurs seemed to strike the right balance with a combination of Bissouma, Maddison and Kulusevski. The former protected the back four, Maddison dropped into pockets of space and sprayed passes across the pitch while Kulusevski drove forward with the ball into threatening positions. It would be a bold call by Postecoglou to start this trio against Arsenal but it might be exactly what is required to take advantage of Rice, Merino and Odegaard's absences. If Postecoglou wants to be a little more cautious, expect to see Sarr slot in alongside Maddison and Bissouma.\\nCarey: There were only three games in which Odegaard did not start in the Premier League last season. Two of those were against relegated teams — Burnley and Sheffield United — making Arsenal's match at Newcastle a decent example of how they set up in the Norwegian's absence.\\nLooking at their passing network (below), it is encouraging to see that those right-sided triangles remained and Saka was not dragged deeper. On that day, Havertz was tasked with playing in the right-sided central-midfield role but, this weekend, he is more likely to play to the left or up front.\\nHaving Zinchenko or Timber as ball-playing inside full-backs will add strength to the midfield, so you would expect to see greater numbers in central areas compared with the above graphic, where Jorginho was tasked with locking things down almost single-handedly.\\nWhoever plays, expect to see the same principles of play with Arsenal and a focus on wide rotations to stretch Spurs' back line. Would a win be more significant for Postecoglou or Arteta?\\nHarris: Postecoglou's second season in charge of Tottenham has started underwhelmingly. They dominated for large spells against Leicester and Newcastle but failed to win. They tore Everton apart and demonstrated how devastating they can be when everything clicks, but Arsenal will be their toughest test yet.\\nTottenham have lost to Arsenal at home for two successive seasons. They only earned one point against them last year and the last time they beat Arsenal was in May 2022 when Antonio Conte was still in charge. If Postecoglou can guide them to victory on Sunday, it would kick their season into gear and be a huge statement of intent.\\nIf Spurs lose, they will have only taken four points out of a possible 12 and the arguments about Postecoglou's entertaining but divisive style of play will become much louder.\\nCampbell: This was always going to be the start of a huge week, with a north London derby, a Champions League opener and a visit to Manchester City crammed into eight days.\\nBut the 1-1 draw with Brighton & Hove Albion means the pressure on beating Spurs is already ramping up.\\nArteta and his Arsenal players can lean on recent triumphs. They have become a team that thrives in big matches. After beating Spurs in May 2022, they went on a 17-game unbeaten streak in London derbies. Against the so-called 'Big Six' last season, they took 22 points from 30, becoming only the fourth team to go unbeaten against their rivals in a single season.\\nA win would not be as significant to Arteta as he has re-established the upper hand in the fixture over the past two seasons but in the context of chasing City, this already feels like a must-win. What are the key tactical battles?\\nHarris: Watching Udogie take on Saka will be exciting and Solanke has the difficult task of escaping William Saliba's clutches.\\nThe key match-up, however, could be Bissouma against Havertz. The Germany international is expected to drop into midfield and, if fit, Bissouma will have the responsibility of tracking his dangerous runs into the box. Bissouma has produced two solid performances after missing the opening game of the season through suspension but can he step up against elite opposition? If Bissouma is not fit enough to play, that task could fall to Bentancur. The Uruguayan is available to start, three days after being charged by the FA over comments he made about team-mate Son.\\nKeep an eye on Maddison and whoever is tasked with marking him, too. Jorginho and Partey are far less mobile than Rice and Merino, which means Maddison might get that crucial extra second he needs to play a killer pass.\\nCampbell: It was the pressing of both teams that dominated the first fixture last season and the set-piece superiority of Arsenal that proved decisive in the second game.\\nBoth of those aspects could prove key again, especially if Arsenal field a less dynamic midfield three. Jorginho was caught dithering on the ball in the 2-2 draw as both teams aggressively pressed the first line of build-up (as can be seen from their above-average 'high press' scores in The Athletic 's match dashboard below).\\nPostecoglou will hope his team are better equipped to deal with that challenge, having had a year to get used to his methods. When Pedro Porro and Udogie drift into the centre, Arsenal's midfield will need to ensure there is no space for Maddison and Bissouma to dictate play.\\nCarey: One of Arsenal's key strengths last season was their suffocating, relentless high press.\\nTheir title challenge was built on rock-solid defensive foundations, and that was not exclusively because of their classy centre-backs — it was from their co-ordinated attackers not letting the opposition play out comfortably.\\nBy contrast, one of Spurs' biggest issues last year was their tendency to give the ball away in their own defensive third. No side had more build-ups that led to an opposition transition than Spurs' 14.9 per 90 minutes in 2023-24, with undoubted room for Postecoglou's side to improve over the summer.\\nSure, we are in a new season now but it is worth keeping an eye out for this part of the game when Spurs have the ball in their own third. If both sides show similar character traits from last season, there could be a key tactical battle at one particular end of the field.

The Champions League, a bold rebrand of the prestigious European Cup, was months away from its launch and the governing body's executive team were gathered to picture how their new flagship competition might look.\\n'I'll never forget taking those brand sketches to Lennart Johansson (UEFA president) and Gerhard Aigner (chief executive),' Craig Thompson, the former managing director at TEAM Marketing, tells The Athletic .\\n'We sat looking at the designs and then at each other. Everyone said immediately: 'That's it'. You never have that when creating a brand because everyone's got an opinion. But everyone was in agreement. The stars represented the best players and teams in Europe, all coming together for football.'\\nThe star ball logo, created by London-based designer Phil Clements, was to form the central pillar of the Champions League brand and, 32 years later, remains largely untouched. Instantly recognisable, it has become synonymous with the most coveted competition in club football, one that has helped drive UEFA's annual revenues above €4.3billion (£3.63bn; $4.76bn).\\nThe Champions League is changing this season, introducing a 36-team league phase, but the strength of its brand has never been more obvious. It has become the competition the elite clubs covet, effectively projecting prestige and aspiration.\\nIt is not for everyone, as those who devised a breakaway European Super League (ESL) might attest, but the climbing TV deals and commercial income illustrate a global appeal that UEFA could not have envisaged at its inception.\\nThere is enormous power in the brand, bringing money to the kitty — buckets of it. Clubs competing in this season's expanded competition are forecast to share a prize pot totalling £2.08billion, a 22 per cent rise on last season.\\nPerhaps only the Premier League can rival the Champions League's growth, but even they struggle to compete on image. The omnipresent star ball, the classical lettering font, the anthem heard a thousand times. The last three decades have seen it all added to football's lexicon.\\n'They've created a brand where we're seeing the best of the best,' says Hugo Hensley, head of sports services at Brand Finance, a leading brand valuation and strategy consultancy. 'It gets all the attention and that brings desirability where the clubs are all obsessed with winning it and that brings more broadcasting, sponsorship, money. That means it keeps becoming this bigger event, bubbling up and up.'\\nGO DEEPER\\nHow the Champions League was created - told by those who did it\\nNothing illustrates the exponential success of the Champions League brand like the numbers.\\nIn the inaugural 1992-93 competition, the total prize pot was 38million Swiss Francs (roughly £34m at current rates), with eventual runners-up AC Milan taking the biggest chunk at 7.5million Swiss Francs (£6.7m). Given this season's winners could walk away with £136m, it is a 20-fold rise in 32 years. Season Club Earnings\\nThe last two decades, in particular, have seen the value of the Champions League spiral. Commercial rights revenue has climbed from £114m a season in 2004-05 to £507m in 2022-23. Broadcast revenues, meanwhile, have rocketed from £410m to £3bn in the same period.\\nAnd they will only increase when UEFA next shares its figures. A new three-year TV cycle will see TNT Sports and Amazon Prime combine to hand over £1.4bn for the UK TV rights, while the American rights, considered a boom market for European football, will be worth $250m (£190m) a season over the next six years, up on the previous $100m a season.\\nBroadcasting deals essentially amount to a measure of popularity and the Champions League's lustre has them queuing up in all markets.\\n'While the World Cup is still the biggest event globally in terms of viewership, the club game has far outgrown the international game in terms of engagement and commercial power,' says Dan Haddad, head of commercial strategy at Octagon, a sports, music and entertainment agency.\\n'The Champions League now has a unique place in the football calendar. It's the one property where all the elite clubs are competing.\\n'The evidence of its success is that nothing else has come along to challenge it or replace it. The whole concept of it was what led to the Super League discussion. The owners of these clubs thought a version of it, where elite European clubs regularly compete with each other, was the way to go.'\\nUEFA cut off that threat at the pass. Twelve of Europe's biggest clubs signed up to the ESL in April 2021, believing there was greater control and financial rewards to be found in a breakaway competition.\\nThat revealed a level of vulnerability for UEFA, with Real Madrid and Barcelona still agitators from within, but the Champions League has retained its position at the top of the mountain for now after grand plans crashed and burned inside 72 chaotic hours.\\nFIFA has plenty of ground to make up with its rival competition, the Club World Cup, which launched its own slick branding this month. That will only be held every four years and does not offer the same assurances over the teams competing. Liverpool, Barcelona and Manchester United, for example, will not play in a Club World Cup until 2029 at the earliest.\\n'FIFA are trying a bit of a land grab with the Club World Cup,' Haddad says. 'They've realised that without having an anchor property within the elite club game, your commercial growth is going to be limited.'\\nIndependent data collected by Brand Finance indicates the Champions League is the most followed club competition in the world and is also the one most commonly associated with having world-class teams, scoring higher than the World Cup, Premier League, Formula 1 and NFL.\\nThe Champions League might have needed to repurpose the European Cup's storied history in its early years, but now it has built its own back catalogue — think Zinedine Zidane's volley at Hampden Park in 2002, Manchester United's Camp Nou comeback three years earlier and all those glories of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. It has become the trophy to mould the legacies of greats.\\nZinedine Zidane's exquisite volley handed Real Madrid #UCL glory for the ninth time, #OTD in 2002.\\nWhat a way to decide a Champions League final.\\n🎬 @btsportfootball pic.twitter.com/4ht0nkAGAV\\n— The Athletic | Football (@TheAthleticFC) May 15, 2023\\n'Within football, the only thing more followed is the World Cup,' says Hensley. 'That's not just Europe, we research the United States, Brazil, China, India and Australia. It's 83 per cent of football fans are following it, which is pretty amazing. The World Cup is at 92 per cent, which is exceptional.\\n'The only real one next is the Premier League. You've got things like a World Cup, the Olympics, even something like Wimbledon. They aren't great comparisons because they're one-off events and don't get the same level of engagement.\\n'Heritage and prestige are massively attractive to sponsors. It's seen as genuine and authentic, long-lasting. They're the attributes you want to associate with. It'll be very difficult for something like the Club World Cup to create a distinct product without it looking like it's copying. Only the Premier League has created this brand that runs through.'\\nUEFA's leap of faith in the early 1990s offered no guarantees. Not everyone was convinced by the case for reform, but there was always potential. How could there not be? The best of every European domestic league competing on midweek nights to crown an eventual king of the continent.\\nYet it needed a brand to reflect the sea change. TEAM, which remains UEFA's marketing partner, was tasked with delivering a commercial programme to UEFA in 1992.\\n'We wanted to it represent the best of the best of European football and the players being the gods of the game,' explains Thompson, formerly of TEAM and now overseeing his own sports consultancy.\\n'We really wanted to elevate the image of football to this almost celestial sport. Our first opening sequence was done by an agency in London and they did this gods of Greece thing, with players cast in marble. These guys came out of the marble and onto the pitch. It was very cool.'\\nThe brand became a thread that ran through all planning. The star ball would be everywhere — on ball boys' bibs, a centre circle flag, the sleeves of shirts, even a centrally positioned advertising board on halfway usually reserved for the highest paying sponsor.\\n'The Champions League was a product,' adds Thompson, who would help TEAM and UEFA take over stadiums before games to ensure consistency across the competition throughout its first decade. 'And it was packaged like a consumer product. It was very different thinking to what existed in those days when FIFA would maybe put up a sign somewhere outside a stadium.\\n'Believe me, we went down to every last detail. When we went to the matches, all the staff wore uniforms. A blazer with the Champions League patch on the chest. We had Champions League cuff links, ties — a Champions League belt buckle.\\n'One of my colleagues was an English guy and when he saw the uniforms he was like, 'I'm never wearing that, I'll look like a clown'. I can tell you he ended up looking a clown like the rest of us.\\n'A big part of the branding was also the music. I gave the same brief to a music company in London and they found Tony Britten (a British music director and composer). We wanted classical music and it was captured so perfectly. Today it's known by everyone in the world.'\\nUEFA has approved subtle redesigns of the Champions League brand and re-recordings of its anthem, including for this season's competition, but both have been largely untouched by time. In truth, there is little need to change.\\nThere were, though, early challenges.\\n'When the Champions League first started you had the French calling it La Ligue des Champions and the Spanish were calling it La Liga de Campeones,' explains Thompson. 'I was on the phone to major papers and radio stations in France and Spain telling them they couldn't say that. It had to be the Champions League.\\n'I'd get, 'You f****** American, we're French, don't tell us to say it in English'. But it was a legal issue, the name of the competition was the Champions League. It went on for three or four years. Nobody would ever believe the efforts we went to promoting that brand. It was in our DNA that the brand was sacred.'\\nThere is no question that UEFA became a commercial pioneer in European sport when launching the Champions League. The Premier League, a behemoth in its own right, has followed many of the Champions League's leads, introducing an anthem before the 2020-21 season and crafting a more consistent visual identity at stadiums, including the match-ball plinth and a branding board that stands behind pre-match handshakes.\\n'With the Champions League, there is the whole consistent visual identity, the sonic identity,' says Haddad. 'Everything about it is unique and premium. If you look at how the Premier League brand has evolved, one of the key reasons they moved away from Barclays as a sole partner was because they didn't have the same visual identity as UEFA and the Champions League.\\n'The Champions League always followed more of an NFL/NBA style approach to building the brand, not having one big commercial partner across it to dictate how your IP has to show. The Premier League definitely took inspiration from the Champions League and how it's positioned globally very consistently.'\\nUEFA's approach to commercial partnerships also helps tell the story of the Champions League's financial successes. The most recent set of accounting figures published by UEFA said commercial revenues alone had climbed to £507million in 2022-23, which is almost the same as Manchester United and Liverpool combined.\\n'Commercially, it was an enormous leap forward (when the Champions League was launched) because it took the American sponsorship model and blended it with European football,' explains sports marketing expert Tim Crow. 'In America, today as then, if you talk to marketers about sponsorship, the first thing they'll talk about is the media buy. That's critical. A sponsorship deal has to include a substantial media presence as part of it. TV ads, basically.\\n'What UEFA did was to take that model on. When you watched the Champions League on TV, the sponsors were bundled into the broadcast before the game, at half-time, after the game.\\n'That not only helped establish the Champions League, it meant it was almost like watching Champions League TV. It made it much easier for sponsors to justify and pay for their involvement. That's ultimately why, commercially, it grew so fast.'\\nThompson helped to build that. 'We were committed to less is more,' he says. 'In those early days, the late 1980s, early '90s, you'd have two or even three rows of advertising in stadiums with a hundred different brands.\\n'No one could ever remember any of them. We decided we'd never have more than eight sponsors for the Champions League and at one point, we reduced that to four. Every broadcaster in Europe couldn't have the rights unless we had the programme sponsorship. At the beginning of every broadcast, it would say, 'This programme is brought to you by Ford and Mastercard', with their logos. That was very valuable.'\\nUEFA has attached itself to long-standing, blue-chip commercial partners. Heineken, Playstation and Mastercard remain among the list of global sponsors of the Champions League capped at seven, also including Lay's, FedEx, crypto.com and Just Eat. Those will pay UEFA anything from between €50million and €100m per season for advertising packages set out in three-year cycles.\\nUEFA can be open for more, too. Bet365 became the first sports betting brand to attach itself to the Champions League this summer. Gambling firms come with their own controversy, but the deal further bumped up revenues carved up predominately through the competing clubs.\\nIt all starts again for another season on Tuesday night, with games staged in Italy, Germany, Spain, Portugal and Switzerland. To its dissenters, it remains in danger of becoming a closed shop for the elite, a 'super-league' in all but name.\\nBut the strength of its brand, for now, only keeps growing.\\n(Top photo: Getty Images; design: Dan Goldfarb)\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n')]"

In 2015, at St Leon-Rot in Germany, Europe held a 10-6 lead going into the singles, only to capitulate to an 8½-3½ defeat and a 14½-13½ loss overall.\"),\n",

A model since childhood (first for her father, a keen amateur snapper, then as a fashion model, then as a muse and artistic collaborator with the surrealist artist Man Ray), Miller learned about photography from both sides of the lens. She knew from experience that taking a picture can be a kind of theft, a one-way transaction in which the subject gives a part of themselves but receives very little in return.\\nThis sobering, serious-minded partial biopic, which focuses on Miller's stint as a war correspondent during the second world war, makes a case that her insight into the power dynamics of photography contributed to the extraordinary potency of her work. Her status as both a victim (her childhood rape is revealed in a jarringly clumsy exchange with her friend and employer, Vogue editor Audrey Withers, played by Andrea Riseborough) and a survivor brought her an unusual empathy with her subjects. She saw the micro-details of combat in a way that her male counterparts frequently overlooked – not just the role played by the unheralded everywoman on the street, but also the shame and humiliation felt by those whom the war had chewed up and spat out along the way. The directorial debut of American cinematographer Ellen Kuras (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), Lee is not the most formally daring or original biopic.

Winslet's Lee is a woman who uses her words as weapons, delivered in a hardboiled screwball heroine's rasp of a voice. It's a voice that is employed extensively. A fictional interview device – a chain-smoking, whisky-swilling older Lee is interrogated by a younger man (Josh O'Connor) – provides a narration that ties together her war experiences.\\nBut Winslet's performance goes deeper than the 'drinking, fucking and taking photographs' that Miller lists as her core skillset at the film's opening, which unfolds at a bohemian pool party in France on the brink of war. She balances the tough-cookie determination that took Miller to a frontline that was, nominally at least, off-limits to women, with a sense of the psychological injuries she accrued.\\nAlong with her friend and colleague, Life magazine photographer David E Scherman (Andy Samberg), Miller was one of the very first civilians to bear witness to the atrocities of the Nazi concentration camps at Buchenwald and Dachau.

Notable photographs – some famous, some less so – are threaded organically through the film.

The score, by Alexandre Desplat, is a bustling, busy orchestral mulch, so generic that it might as well have been pulled out of a drawer marked 'prestige period pieces'.

The German view was that the pound was overvalued, and that it was up to the British to deal with that problem.\\nTo cut a long story short – and the markets were going short of the pound – the belief that the UK could not maintain an overvalued currency became overwhelming, and speculation forced the pound out of the ERM.

Despite the firm pushback against market speculation, the futures market continues to discount around an 80% chance of a cut by the end of the year. Through July, Australia has created almost 320k jobs (273 full-time posts) compared with 245k jobs (168k full-time) in the first seven months of 2023. Still, the unemployment rate has gradually risen to 4.2% from 3.9% at the end of last year. What is happening is the participation rate has risen from 66.6% at the end of 2023 to 67.1% in July. Migration has boosted Australia's population. The Australian dollar initially extended its pullback from the $0.6825 high set in late August and fell to almost $0.6620 in the middle of last week, just above the 200-day moving average. The broad setback to the US dollar saw it recover to nearly $0.6735 before the weekend. Overcoming resistance in the $0.6750-$0.6770 area could re-target the high. However, we are not convinced that the uptrend has, in fact, resumed. Mexico:\"),\n",

Nearby was a large pile of logs. 'It's a pretty neanderthal arrangement,' she explained. 'When the power shuts off we feed the stove with wood. In winter we do this round the clock. Our plants require constant temperatures. They don't like cold and hot.'\\nInside the glass nursery were dozens of rare specimens. All were bromeliads native to the Americas. Silvery wisps of beard-like Tillandsia descended from a pipe. A pineapple poked out of a stem. A screen next to the stove protected a group of starfish-like earth stars, native to Brazil. The collection needed a minimum temperature of 10C, Yaroslavska – a senior researcher – said. Below that everything would die off.\\nThe greenhouse is one of eight in the Mykola Hryshko national botanical garden in Kyiv. Founded in 1935, it is Ukraine's biggest garden and one of the largest in Europe. It is home to about 13,000 species of trees, flowers and other plants from around the world. The 52-hectare (130 acres) site has scientific departments and two laboratories. With its roses and camellias, it is a popular venue with wedding photographers.\\nBut the park is now staring at disaster. In recent months, Russia has systematically destroyed most of Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Power cuts in the capital and across the country are common, with the situation getting worse. The city authorities have said they will not be able to guarantee supply in the freezing months ahead. Prices for electricity have doubled, as the garden's funding has shrunk.\"),\n",

Money is so tight he and his colleagues recently took a pay cut. Last winter, £55,000 in donations kept the garden going, allowing the purchase of 242 tonnes of fuel pellets. Volunteers chopped firewood. The garden is appealing for help, under the hashtag #greenhousewarming.\\nBefore the first chilly night of October arrives, Ivannikov said his team urgently needed additional generators. The orchid house had a unique collection of exotic specimens and was especially vulnerable. Last year, three Samsung heat pumps were fitted to maintain temperatures at 20-22C. But there was no back-up in the case of a prolonged shutdown.\\nIvannikov pointed out some of the collection's highlights. They included an egg-in-the-nest orchid from China – it has a strange white-and-purple-spotted flower – and a delicate green jewel orchid. Another example – Doritis pulcherrima – was descended from a plant sent into space in 1986. The orchid was part of a Soviet mission to the Mir space station, where the crew performed experiments in biology.\\nThe garden collaborates with international partners. In 2014, it sent plants to Vietnam, after their original habitat was destroyed to make way for banana and coffee crops. 'I travelled with 45 orchids,' Ivannikov recalled. 'I watched on TV, as Russia took Crimea.' Scientific conferences with Moscow stopped. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion Ivannikov took his family out of Kyiv and returned a week later.\"),\n",

From time to time, falling debris breaks glass in the hothouses. Blast waves from explosions have dislodged a chunk of wall and knocked over red-listed plants. 'We haven't had a direct hit. But we suffered a lot of damage,' Ivannikov said. In January, a rocket flew above the main orangery, a giant glass dome containing banks of shaggy vines and a towering king palm.\\nIryna Yudakova, an engineer, was inside. 'I didn't hear the air alarm. I went out and saw a streak in the sky,' she said. 'There was an explosion. A piece of shrapnel fell next to me. Another hit a window. I was lucky.' Yudakova said she enjoyed her job but that the pay – 8,000 hryvnia a month (£150) – was measly. 'Previously I was a psychologist. When the war started I lost my clients. Without my husband I couldn't survive,' she said.\\nYudakova's duties include looking after the rhododendrons and azaleas. In February, one of her favourite plants – an old specimen bred in Germany in the 1930s – lost most of its leaves during a blackout. 'It got too cold,' she said. 'The younger, smaller plants survive better.' Standing next to the denuded shrub, she reflected: 'It's like losing a relative or a pet. I think of them as my kids. I water them, care for them, talk to them.'\\nMany employees have worked at the garden for decades. Others fled Russian occupation. Among them are a father and daughter in charge of the bonsai collection, who escaped from Mariupol. Ivannikov said his soldier cousin died defending the eastern city, which Russia flattened in 2022.

Proceeds went to Ukraine's armed forces.\\nBack at the bromeliad house Yaroslavska said she would like to replace the building – constructed in 1976 under communism – with a modern, more heat-efficient version. She recognised there was no point in making improvements while the war rumbled on and bombs fell randomly from the sky. For now, the objective was for the garden and its 4,000 tropical and subtropical plants to get through the coming winter.\\nThere were also smaller challenges, she said. A bold squirrel had climbed in through a ventilation window and made off with the figs from a rare tree. Apart from getting rid of the squirrel, what else did she want?

Vice presidential candidate JD Vance said Monday that 'Haitian illegal immigrants' are 'causing chaos,' while former President Donald Trump emphatically, and falsely, claimed during his Tuesday debate with Vice President Kamala Harris that, 'they're eating the pets of the people that live there, and this is what's happening in our country.'\\nThe comments echo well-worn tropes, and past attempts to tie Haitian immigrants to everything from the spread of illness to upticks in crime.\\nRepublicans have elevated these messages as they seek to make immigration a flashpoint in the November election, capitalizing on voters' dissatisfaction with current trends. The attacks also come as rampant political instability and gang violence in Haiti has displaced thousands of people — and as the Biden administration has approved temporary protections and humanitarian parole for some new arrivals.\\nThe stereotypes the GOP is harping on, however, have been around for much longer.\\nIn fact, as experts tell Vox, these types of ugly attacks are the byproduct of centuries of anti-Black racism and xenophobic sentiment, which have been used over and over to justify restrictive immigration policies that single out Haitian people. The decision to resurface them in 2024 is, once again, creating a palpably dangerous environment, and adding to this legacy.\"),\n",

'It's the idea that they could do something so inhuman, so un-American. That's the message underneath, that these people will never be like us.'\\nAttacks on Haitian immigrants tap into the longstanding US framing of Haiti as a threat.\\n'Racism and xenophobia against Haitians among white Americans can be traced all the way back to the Haitian Revolution when Haitians … [overthrew] the system of slavery and [established] the world's first Black republic,' Carl Lindskoog, the author of a book on the US's detention of Haitian immigrants, told Vox. 'Since then, Haitians have been seen by many white Americans as a threat to white rule and have been treated as such.'\\nIn 1804, Haitians successfully overthrew colonial rule and enslavement by France. Concerned that Haitians' victory would inspire enslaved people in America to pursue a similar revolution, the US did not recognize Haiti's independence for nearly six decades.\\nFollowing the revolution, France used military force to demand financial restitution for loss of the colony, forcing Haiti to borrow money to cover its demands. The US and France provided those loans — and used them to continue exerting control over Haiti's finances for years. In total, a New York Times investigation found that reparations to France cost Haiti's economy $21 billion and directly contributed to poverty and financial problems that still plague the country to this day.\"),\n",

In reality, it mounted the occupation to prevent France or Germany from gaining ground in the region, which was viewed as strategically valuable. During this time, the US set up a system of forced labor, and sold Haitian land to American corporations.\\nThe takeover also sent a demeaning message: that Haiti wasn't capable of handling its own affairs.\\n'A lot of scholars have talked about … rhetoric that's used to justify invasion around civilizing a society,' says Jamella Gow, a sociologist at Bowdoin University. 'This notion of Haitians as backwards, criminal and dangerous started way back then.' The association of Haiti with voodoo practices, something self-help author Marianne Williamson, who ran in the Democratic presidential primary in 2020 and 2024, evoked this week, is another tactic that's been used to suggest that they're a 'mysterious … migrant other,' says Gow.\\nIn the decades since, the US's treatment of Haitian immigrants has built on and reinforced these ideas. That was evident in the 1970s, when a wave of Haitian migrants sought asylum in the US as they tried to escape political persecution from US-backed dictator Jean Claude Duvalier. Many of these arrivals were detained and denied asylum, though they met the qualifications for it.\"),\n",

In a 1980 Haitian Refugee Center v. Civiletti case, the Fifth Circuit ruled that the US government had singled Haitians out and practiced blatant racism in its immigration policies. Despite this decision, then-President Jimmy Carter and his successors managed to find loopholes to keep up this approach. In the years that followed, while a surge of Cuban and Haitian migrants came to the US around the same time, Haitian people were far more likely to stay in detention compared to their Cuban counterparts.\\nThe stigmatization of Haitian immigrants continued, too, in subsequent decades, including efforts to associate Haitians with illnesses, such as HIV. In the early 1980s, when no scientific name had been given to HIV/AIDS, the press and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention deemed it the 4H disease — which stood for 'Haitians, Homosexuals, Hemophiliacs, and Heroin users,' in part because some of the early cases of the illness included Haitian people.\\nA fear of HIV — and the framing of Haitian immigrants as carriers of disease — was among the reasons that led the US to detain Haitian asylum seekers at Guantanamo Bay during the 1990s. (Thousands were detained and deported, while some who were HIV-positive were threatened with indefinite detention.) That's part of a long history of the US government deeming immigrants health hazards in order to stymie their entry into the country — a practice that was again embraced during the Covid-19 pandemic.\"),\n",

Republicans and right-wing figures have since invoked Clark's death to highlight the threat immigrants pose — something his parents have begged them to stop doing.\\nThis hostility toward Haitian immigrants has resulted in neo-Nazis and Republican lawmakers spreading lies about immigrants eating not just pets, but also ducks from the local parks.

Cristian Romero has made a couple of costly errors, which is somewhat understandable when you consider he only spent a couple of weeks on holiday after winning the Copa America with Argentina before returning for pre-season. Romero could have done with a rest during the international break but he played twice for Argentina. Tottenham fans will be hoping the extra game time has boosted his sharpness and that it does not leave him feeling knackered.\\nCarey: It is a cliche but it's true — all rules go out of the window in derby games. The quick turnaround after the international break might mean that the contest is a little lower in intensity, but this one is difficult to predict.\\nFor Arsenal, it is not just the blow of — as seems very likely — losing Martin Odegaard's quality to injury but also how much it affects them tactically. Arsenal's captain is a key component of their right-sided rotations with Ben White and Saka — a trio who have been so consistent for the past 18 months. They have plenty of quality elsewhere across the pitch, but add in Declan Rice's suspension and Arsenal fans' concerns become understandable.\\nSpurs have not made the blistering start of last season but have played well.

Postecoglou's philosophy is all about dominating the ball and pressuring the other team high up the pitch. When it works, as in their 4-0 victory over Everton last month, Tottenham do not let their opponents breathe and they score goals for fun.\\nThe style of play comes with a lot of risk. Spurs push so many players forward that they leave themselves vulnerable to counter-attacks. Saka's goal in Arsenal's 3-2 victory at the end of last season is a prime example of this. As can be seen below, Spurs dominated possession and territory but Arsenal took their chances.\\nHarry Kane is no longer at Spurs but Son Heung-min remains a threat. The speed of Brennan Johnson and Wilson Odobert will cause problems for Arsenal's full-backs, too.

Goals seem inevitable but do not be surprised to see Arteta employ a slightly more restrained, counter-attacking approach to compensate for the absence of Rice and Odegaard. How might Arsenal's midfield injuries affect things?\\nCampbell: Arsenal will probably be without what Arteta intended to be his first-choice midfield this season, with Mikel Merino and Odegaard both injured and Rice suspended.\\nThe sale of Emile Smith Rowe and the loan exit of Fabio Vieira means Arsenal cannot replicate the balance they would usually have.\\nHavertz dropping into midfield, with Jesus taking his place up front, is a natural solution to the left-sided central-midfielder gap, but Jorginho and Thomas Partey are the only other senior conventional midfielders available.

The 27-year-old has been accompanied by a rotating cast of Rodrigo Bentancur, Yves Bissouma, Pape Matar Sarr or Dejan Kulusevski, depending on the quality of the opposition.\\nIn the second half of their 2-1 defeat by Newcastle, Spurs seemed to strike the right balance with a combination of Bissouma, Maddison and Kulusevski. The former protected the back four, Maddison dropped into pockets of space and sprayed passes across the pitch while Kulusevski drove forward with the ball into threatening positions. It would be a bold call by Postecoglou to start this trio against Arsenal but it might be exactly what is required to take advantage of Rice, Merino and Odegaard's absences. If Postecoglou wants to be a little more cautious, expect to see Sarr slot in alongside Maddison and Bissouma.\\nCarey: There were only three games in which Odegaard did not start in the Premier League last season.

Would a win be more significant for Postecoglou or Arteta?\\nHarris: Postecoglou's second season in charge of Tottenham has started underwhelmingly.

Everyone said immediately: 'That's it'. You never have that when creating a brand because everyone's got an opinion. But everyone was in agreement. The stars represented the best players and teams in Europe, all coming together for football.'\\nThe star ball logo, created by London-based designer Phil Clements, was to form the central pillar of the Champions League brand and, 32 years later, remains largely untouched. Instantly recognisable, it has become synonymous with the most coveted competition in club football, one that has helped drive UEFA's annual revenues above €4.3billion (£3.63bn; $4.76bn).\\nThe Champions League is changing this season, introducing a 36-team league phase, but the strength of its brand has never been more obvious. It has become the competition the elite clubs covet, effectively projecting prestige and aspiration.\\nIt is not for everyone, as those who devised a breakaway European Super League (ESL) might attest, but the climbing TV deals and commercial income illustrate a global appeal that UEFA could not have envisaged at its inception.\"),\n",

Clubs competing in this season's expanded competition are forecast to share a prize pot totalling £2.08billion, a 22 per cent rise on last season.\\nPerhaps only the Premier League can rival the Champions League's growth, but even they struggle to compete on image. The omnipresent star ball, the classical lettering font, the anthem heard a thousand times.

'It gets all the attention and that brings desirability where the clubs are all obsessed with winning it and that brings more broadcasting, sponsorship, money. That means it keeps becoming this bigger event, bubbling up and up.'\\nGO DEEPER\\nHow the Champions League was created - told by those who did it\\nNothing illustrates the exponential success of the Champions League brand like the numbers.\\nIn the inaugural 1992-93 competition, the total prize pot was 38million Swiss Francs (roughly £34m at current rates), with eventual runners-up AC Milan taking the biggest chunk at 7.5million Swiss Francs (£6.7m). Given this season's winners could walk away with £136m, it is a 20-fold rise in 32 years. Season Club Earnings\\nThe last two decades, in particular, have seen the value of the Champions League spiral. Commercial rights revenue has climbed from £114m a season in 2004-05 to £507m in 2022-23. Broadcast revenues, meanwhile, have rocketed from £410m to £3bn in the same period.\"),\n",

It's the one property where all the elite clubs are competing.\\n'The evidence of its success is that nothing else has come along to challenge it or replace it. The whole concept of it was what led to the Super League discussion. The owners of these clubs thought a version of it, where elite European clubs regularly compete with each other, was the way to go.'\\nUEFA cut off that threat at the pass. Twelve of Europe's biggest clubs signed up to the ESL in April 2021, believing there was greater control and financial rewards to be found in a breakaway competition.\\nThat revealed a level of vulnerability for UEFA, with Real Madrid and Barcelona still agitators from within, but the Champions League has retained its position at the top of the mountain for now after grand plans crashed and burned inside 72 chaotic hours.\"),\n",

It'll be very difficult for something like the Club World Cup to create a distinct product without it looking like it's copying. Only the Premier League has created this brand that runs through.'\\nUEFA's leap of faith in the early 1990s offered no guarantees. Not everyone was convinced by the case for reform, but there was always potential. How could there not be? The best of every European domestic league competing on midweek nights to crown an eventual king of the continent.\\nYet it needed a brand to reflect the sea change. TEAM, which remains UEFA's marketing partner, was tasked with delivering a commercial programme to UEFA in 1992.\\n'We wanted to it represent the best of the best of European football and the players being the gods of the game,' explains Thompson, formerly of TEAM and now overseeing his own sports consultancy.\\n'We really wanted to elevate the image of football to this almost celestial sport. Our first opening sequence was done by an agency in London and they did this gods of Greece thing, with players cast in marble. These guys came out of the marble and onto the pitch.

'And it was packaged like a consumer product. It was very different thinking to what existed in those days when FIFA would maybe put up a sign somewhere outside a stadium.\\n'Believe me, we went down to every last detail. When we went to the matches, all the staff wore uniforms. A blazer with the Champions League patch on the chest. We had Champions League cuff links, ties — a Champions League belt buckle.\\n'One of my colleagues was an English guy and when he saw the uniforms he was like, 'I'm never wearing that, I'll look like a clown'. I can tell you he ended up looking a clown like the rest of us.\\n'A big part of the branding was also the music. I gave the same brief to a music company in London and they found Tony Britten (a British music director and composer). We wanted classical music and it was captured so perfectly. Today it's known by everyone in the world.'\\nUEFA has approved subtle redesigns of the Champions League brand and re-recordings of its anthem, including for this season's competition, but both have been largely untouched by time. In truth, there is little need to change.\\nThere were, though, early challenges.\\n'When the Champions League first started you had the French calling it La Ligue des Champions and the Spanish were calling it La Liga de Campeones,' explains Thompson. 'I was on the phone to major papers and radio stations in France and Spain telling them they couldn't say that. It had to be the Champions League.\"),\n",

But it was a legal issue, the name of the competition was the Champions League. It went on for three or four years. Nobody would ever believe the efforts we went to promoting that brand. It was in our DNA that the brand was sacred.'\\nThere is no question that UEFA became a commercial pioneer in European sport when launching the Champions League. The Premier League, a behemoth in its own right, has followed many of the Champions League's leads, introducing an anthem before the 2020-21 season and crafting a more consistent visual identity at stadiums, including the match-ball plinth and a branding board that stands behind pre-match handshakes.\\n'With the Champions League, there is the whole consistent visual identity, the sonic identity,' says Haddad. 'Everything about it is unique and premium. If you look at how the Premier League brand has evolved, one of the key reasons they moved away from Barclays as a sole partner was because they didn't have the same visual identity as UEFA and the Champions League.\\n'The Champions League always followed more of an NFL/NBA style approach to building the brand, not having one big commercial partner across it to dictate how your IP has to show. The Premier League definitely took inspiration from the Champions League and how it's positioned globally very consistently.'\\nUEFA's approach to commercial partnerships also helps tell the story of the Champions League's financial successes. The most recent set of accounting figures published by UEFA said commercial revenues alone had climbed to £507million in 2022-23, which is almost the same as Manchester United and Liverpool combined.\"),\n",

'In America, today as then, if you talk to marketers about sponsorship, the first thing they'll talk about is the media buy. That's critical. A sponsorship deal has to include a substantial media presence as part of it. TV ads, basically.\\n'What UEFA did was to take that model on. When you watched the Champions League on TV, the sponsors were bundled into the broadcast before the game, at half-time, after the game.\\n'That not only helped establish the Champions League, it meant it was almost like watching Champions League TV. It made it much easier for sponsors to justify and pay for their involvement. That's ultimately why, commercially, it grew so fast.'\\nThompson helped to build that. 'We were committed to less is more,' he says. 'In those early days, the late 1980s, early '90s, you'd have two or even three rows of advertising in stadiums with a hundred different brands.\\n'No one could ever remember any of them. We decided we'd never have more than eight sponsors for the Champions League and at one point, we reduced that to four. Every broadcaster in Europe couldn't have the rights unless we had the programme sponsorship. At the beginning of every broadcast, it would say, 'This programme is brought to you by Ford and Mastercard', with their logos. That was very valuable.'\"),\n",

      "Since 1977, NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft has been exploring the solar system and beyond.\n",
      "The probe was the first spacecraft to cross the heliosphere — the sun's bubble of magnetic fields and particles that extends beyond planetary orbits — and venture into interstellar space, or space between stars. Along the way, Voyager 1 found a thin ring around Jupiter and two new Jovian moons as well as five new moons orbiting Saturn.\n",
      "Now, the space agency may have found a way to keep the 47-year-old probe communicating with Earth from billions of miles away.\n",
      "NASA engineers successfully fired up a set of thrusters Voyager 1 hasn't used in decades, which could help keep its antenna pointed at Earth.\n",
      "In other space news, NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will be able to vote via absentee ballot from low-Earth orbit in November's election. The duo's stay aboard the International Space Station was extended until 2025 after arriving in June on a test flight of Boeing's troubled Starliner spacecraft. The trip was initially expected to last about eight days.\n",

      "Ultimately, Ukraine continues to argue that the ability to use Western-supplied long-range missiles inside Russia is part of the complex jigsaw puzzle of ending this war on Kyiv's terms — and a way to show Russia it cannot outlast Ukraine's allies.\n",
      "Zelensky is heading to the US on the one hand buoyed by the Kursk offensive providing fresh evidence of both Ukrainian ingenuity and, he argues, the flimsiness of Russian 'red lines,' but on the other hand motivated by the prospect of a third winter with critical electricity shortages, and still inadequate supplies of equipment and manpower.\n",
      "'We need to have this long-range capability not only on the occupied territory of Ukraine, but also on Russian territory,' he told a large gathering of Ukraine's allies at the US' Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany earlier this month, 'so Russia is motivated to seek peace.'\n",

      "Servers immediately began ferrying beers — each carrying up to 10 glass mugs — across the packed tents. Guests started clinking their mugs and taking deep gulps of beer in the stuffy heat inside as bands played traditional Bavarian folk music. But plaques reminded them not to dance on the tables.\n",
      "The festival runs through Oct. 6 in 18 large tents covering the Theresienwiese fairground. About 6 million visitors are expected over the festival's 16 days — up to 600,000 each day — and can expect to shell out between 13.60 and 15.30 euros ($15.12 to $17.01) for a big mug of beer.
