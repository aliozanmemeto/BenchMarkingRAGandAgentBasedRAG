The Cameroonian centre-back has not had a club since his contract expired at Liverpool earlier this summer but is now seemingly ready to get back into first-team action.\nWest Ham have struggled so far this season winning just one game under Julen Lopetegui while also keeping just a single clean sheet. This is after the club spent over \u00a3120 million in the transfer window, but their business doesn't appear to be over.\nMatip was a great servant for Liverpool throughout his eight years at Anfield, although he did suffer his fair share of injuries. The defender is 34 years old, so those knocks and muscle injuries could become far more regular occurrences as the football calendar continues to be filled up.\nThe Hammers are already just three points above the drop zone having won one of their opening four league games. What is more worrying, is the fact they've shipped six goals in the Premier League, despite having \u00a340 million Max Kilman at the heart of their defence.\nAccording to reports, West Ham could soon be handed a defensive boost, with Matip keen to remain in the Premier League. However, the Hammers are not alone in their pursuit of the veteran defender with clubs in both England and Germany keen to secure his services.\nThe same report claims that whoever signs Matip in the coming days or weeks will have to hand him a two-year deal and not a short-term one. This is what's seemingly holding up the defender from landing a new club, his long-term contract demands.",

They also show that doctors aren't the only health workers at risk \u2013 nurses, trainees, and other staffers all face unwanted attention and threats.\nFor example, Umut Can \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, a medical student in Turkey and a leader in the European Medical Students' Association (EMSA), told Euronews Health that his female colleagues try to dress conservatively to avoid being leered at by patients.\nPaul de Raeve, a longtime nurse and secretary general of the European Federation of Nursing Associations, said he typically tried to get someone else in the room if he felt patients were making suggestive comments.\nHe said aggression toward nurses \u2013 including sexual harassment, physical and verbal attacks \u2013 has only escalated in recent years, with a profound effect on health workers' satisfaction at work.\n'COVID-19 has aggravated this situation,' de Raeve told Euronews Health. 'We are going to lose our nurses \u2026 because they said, 'enough is enough'''.\nThe issue also remains heavily stigmatised, and many health care workers don't report these incidents because they don't believe anything will be done to remedy the situation, de Raeve, Villanueva, and Kamau-Mitchell all said.\n'If you're a busy doctor and you're subject to this, and you're under such pressure that you don't even have time to report it or think much about it, you just trod on,' Villanueva said.",

Civiletti case, the Fifth Circuit ruled that the US government had singled Haitians out and practiced blatant racism in its immigration policies. Despite this decision, then-President Jimmy Carter and his successors managed to find loopholes to keep up this approach. In the years that followed, while a surge of Cuban and Haitian migrants came to the US around the same time, Haitian people were far more likely to stay in detention compared to their Cuban counterparts.\nThe stigmatization of Haitian immigrants continued, too, in subsequent decades, including efforts to associate Haitians with illnesses, such as HIV. In the early 1980s, when no scientific name had been given to HIV/AIDS, the press and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention deemed it the 4H disease \u2014 which stood for 'Haitians, Homosexuals, Hemophiliacs, and Heroin users,' in part because some of the early cases of the illness included Haitian people.\nA fear of HIV \u2014 and the framing of Haitian immigrants as carriers of disease \u2014 was among the reasons that led the US to detain Haitian asylum seekers at Guantanamo Bay during the 1990s. (Thousands were detained and deported, while some who were HIV-positive were threatened with indefinite detention.) That's part of a long history of the US government deeming immigrants health hazards in order to stymie their entry into the country \u2014 a practice that was again embraced during the Covid-19 pandemic.",

In a broad dollar decline, the yuan rose to its best levels of the year. It had gotten sufficiently strong that the newswires were reporting that state-owned banks were buying dollars. The dollar recovered in the first half of last week before selling off to a four-day low before the weekend. Banks set prime rates this week, but they seem to be waiting for the PBOC to move first. How the state-owned banks relate to the state is debatable. The dominant view seems to be that when these banks operate in the foreign exchange or bond market, they are doing the bidding of the government. Yet, at the same time, those same banks have resisted pressure from Beijing to lend to property developers and to refrain from buying government bonds. If those banks bought dollars, as press reports suggest, after selling them above CNY7.25 in July, who realizes the profit?

The 27-year-old has been accompanied by a rotating cast of Rodrigo Bentancur, Yves Bissouma, Pape Matar Sarr or Dejan Kulusevski, depending on the quality of the opposition.\nIn the second half of their 2-1 defeat by Newcastle, Spurs seemed to strike the right balance with a combination of Bissouma, Maddison and Kulusevski. The former protected the back four, Maddison dropped into pockets of space and sprayed passes across the pitch while Kulusevski drove forward with the ball into threatening positions. It would be a bold call by Postecoglou to start this trio against Arsenal but it might be exactly what is required to take advantage of Rice, Merino and Odegaard's absences. If Postecoglou wants to be a little more cautious, expect to see Sarr slot in alongside Maddison and Bissouma.\nCarey: There were only three games in which Odegaard did not start in the Premier League last season.

She knew from experience that taking a picture can be a kind of theft, a one-way transaction in which the subject gives a part of themselves but receives very little in return.\nThis sobering, serious-minded partial biopic, which focuses on Miller's stint as a war correspondent during the second world war, makes a case that her insight into the power dynamics of photography contributed to the extraordinary potency of her work. Her status as both a victim (her childhood rape is revealed in a jarringly clumsy exchange with her friend and employer, Vogue editor Audrey Withers, played by Andrea Riseborough) and a survivor brought her an unusual empathy with her subjects. She saw the micro-details of combat in a way that her male counterparts frequently overlooked \u2013 not just the role played by the unheralded everywoman on the street, but also the shame and humiliation felt by those whom the war had chewed up and spat out along the way.

It went on for three or four years. Nobody would ever believe the efforts we went to promoting that brand. It was in our DNA that the brand was sacred.'\nThere is no question that UEFA became a commercial pioneer in European sport when launching the Champions League. The Premier League, a behemoth in its own right, has followed many of the Champions League's leads, introducing an anthem before the 2020-21 season and crafting a more consistent visual identity at stadiums, including the match-ball plinth and a branding board that stands behind pre-match handshakes.\n'With the Champions League, there is the whole consistent visual identity, the sonic identity,' says Haddad. 'Everything about it is unique and premium. If you look at how the Premier League brand has evolved, one of the key reasons they moved away from Barclays as a sole partner was because they didn't have the same visual identity as UEFA and the Champions League.\n'The Champions League always followed more of an NFL/NBA style approach to building the brand, not having one big commercial partner across it to dictate how your IP has to show. The Premier League definitely took inspiration from the Champions League and how it's positioned globally very consistently.'\nUEFA's approach to commercial partnerships also helps tell the story of the Champions League's financial successes.

The market is confident that the Bank of Japan will stand pat this week, allowing its late July rate hike and the start of QT to continue to be absorbed by businesses and investors. The swaps market has eight basis points of a hike discounted for this year and another 10 bp in the first half of next year. Despite this, the yen has remained firm. Japanese investors have continued to buy foreign assets (yen sales), while the speculators in the CME futures market continued to buy yen and extend their net long position. The BOJ will see August CPI figures before it makes its decision, but the Tokyo CPI has already been reported and this means the national report will add little new. That said, headline CPI likely rose above 3.0% for a new high since last October, after a 2.8% rate for the past three months. The core rate, which excludes fresh food, is likely to have risen for the fifth consecutive month, and at 2.6%, it also would be at the highest since last October.",

Winslet's Lee is a woman who uses her words as weapons, delivered in a hardboiled screwball heroine's rasp of a voice. It's a voice that is employed extensively. A fictional interview device \u2013 a chain-smoking, whisky-swilling older Lee is interrogated by a younger man (Josh O'Connor) \u2013 provides a narration that ties together her war experiences.\nBut Winslet's performance goes deeper than the 'drinking, fucking and taking photographs' that Miller lists as her core skillset at the film's opening, which unfolds at a bohemian pool party in France on the brink of war. She balances the tough-cookie determination that took Miller to a frontline that was, nominally at least, off-limits to women, with a sense of the psychological injuries she accrued.\nAlong with her friend and colleague, Life magazine photographer David E Scherman (Andy Samberg), Miller was one of the very first civilians to bear witness to the atrocities of the Nazi concentration camps at Buchenwald and Dachau.

The odds now are seen at less than 20%. After this week's meeting, there are two more before the end of the year. The market has two cuts discounted. Two quarter-point cuts this year would bring the base rate to 4.5%. The swaps market sees the rate near 3.60% in the middle of next year. Ahead of the BOE meeting, August's CPI will be reported. The UK's headline inflation rose at an annualized pace of less than 1% in the three months through July. This likely overstates the disinflationary pressure, but there is scope for a decline in the year-over-year pace (2.2% in July) in August and September before firming in Q4 and into January 2025. The core rate has been stickier, but 1) it has not risen on a year-over-year basis since May 2023, and 2) it has been a little more than halved from 6.9% in July 2023 to 3.3% in July 2024. Services inflation has been stickier still. It was at 5.2% in July. It has fallen steadily from 6.5% pace in January. The slower growth of wages is expected to slow services inflation. Last week, the UK reported a 4.0% rise in average weekly earnings (three months, year-over-year), the slowest since late 2020. At the end of next week, August retail sales will be reported. On a volume basis, UK retail sales (including gasoline) have risen by an average of 0.6% a month. However, consumption is a much larger category and although the UK economy was the fastest growing among the G7 in H1 24, consumption looks like it may have been a drag, but it is expected to be improving this quarter, even as overall economic activity decelerates from 0.6% quarter-over-quarter in Q2 and 0.7% in Q1 24.",

Rescuers used boats to transport people to safety in a neighborhood flooded by the raging Opava River.\n'There's no reason to wait,' Mayor Tom\u00e1\u0161 Navr\u00e1til told Czech public radio. He said that the situation was worse than during the last devastating floods in 1997, known as the 'flood of the century.'\n'We have to focus on saving lives,' Prime Minister Petr Fiala told Czech public television on Sunday. His government was to possibly meet Monday to assess the damages.\nThe worst 'is not behind us yet,' the prime minister warned.\nThousands of others also were evacuated in the towns of Krnov, which was almost completely flooded, and Cesky Tesin. The Oder River that flows to Poland was reaching extreme levels in the city of Ostrava and in Bohumin, prompting mass evacuations.\nOstrava, the regional capital is the third-largest Czech city.

        "context": "But in last season's first meeting, the enduring issue of playing well but spurning big chances prevented them from killing off the game early. Gabriel Jesus was most guilty and with the Brazilian potentially filling in for Kai Havertz up front, the question of whether Arsenal have enough killer instinct hangs over them.\nTransitions will be key again for both teams and a first start for Raheem Sterling could help Arsenal add that extra incisiveness. Goals seem inevitable but do not be surprised to see Arteta employ a slightly more restrained, counter-attacking approach to compensate for the absence of Rice and Odegaard. How might Arsenal's midfield injuries affect things?\nCampbell: Arsenal will probably be without what Arteta intended to be his first-choice midfield this season, with Mikel Merino and Odegaard both injured and Rice suspended.\nThe sale of Emile Smith Rowe and the loan exit of Fabio Vieira means Arsenal cannot replicate the balance they would usually have.\nHavertz dropping into midfield, with Jesus taking his place up front, is a natural solution to the left-sided central-midfielder gap, but Jorginho and Thomas Partey are the only other senior conventional midfielders available. Partey being pushed forward slightly to allow the Italian to play at No 6 is one option, as is tweaking the shape to employ a double pivot, but both players can leave Arsenal lacking mobility and creativity.\nDropping Leandro Trossard back to play alongside Havertz would be an aggressive move but would risk leaving Arsenal too open. Shifting either Oleksandr Zinchenko or Jurrien Timber forward into midfield could help Arteta maximise continuity in their build-up play.",

The question asks whether these injuries will affect their build-up play, and the context suggests that they might lack mobility and creativity without Partey and Xhaka. However, the inclusion of Tierney and Martinelli could provide enough creativity and mobility to compensate. The rationale for the total rating of 4 is that while Arsenal's midfield injuries could limit their options and force Arteta to employ different tactics, the inclusion of Tierney and Martinelli could provide enough creativity and mobility to compensate. Therefore, a total rating of 4 is appropriate.\n\n"
