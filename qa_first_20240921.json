Trump visited Republicans on Capitol Hill, he hinted at a vision for a vastly different tax system than what the United States has employed for decades.\nRather than taxing Americans on the money they earn at their jobs and on their investments, Mr. Trump instead suggested imposing a broad tax on the goods that Americans buy from abroad. In his view, such tariffs could replace income taxes as the main source of federal revenue.\nThe idea, briefly floated behind closed doors, seemed to fizzle, and Mr. Trump did not publicly repeat it as experts questioned whether such a model would even be possible. But in the weeks since, Mr. Trump has floated ideas that, taken together, would fundamentally change the way Americans are taxed, eroding the income tax while embracing expansive tariffs as a way to raise federal revenue.",

Town officials snubbed each other at community meetings and filed competing lawsuits. \"We used to tease each other that, for them, Surfside was spelled with an E instead of a U,\" says Tim Will, who served as a Surfside commissioner during the spat. \"They don't interact with us unless you're cutting their lawns or building their piers.\"\nWill was particularly bothered by the bridge connecting the two towns, which receives public money for repair projects but which the public is forbidden from crossing.

About 15 years prior to the Yellowstone and Idaho reintroductions, and just a few years after they had received federal endangered species status [granted in 1974], they walked down from Canada into north-western Montana and Glacier national park without any help or fanfare. And they began to filter out. The approximately 3,000 wild wolves in the western US today are, in part, because of that natural recolonisation.",

Whenever we went to take inventory at the tank, we would be dropping the weight into this metal chamber, which was filled with soybean oil, but the balance of the tank had water in it.'\nMiller ordered a surprise inspection at Allied. Inspectors found all the tank openings were welded shut except for the measuring hatch. They then found water in the five tanks they were able to check. However, when they returned after the weekend, there was nothing suspicious in the other tanks. A report later attributed water to 'broken steam pipes.'
