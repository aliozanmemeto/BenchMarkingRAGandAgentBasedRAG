            "summary": "BERLIN (AP) \u2014 A state election is taking place in Brandenburg on Sunday, three weeks after a far-right party made gains in two other states in eastern Germany.\nAround 2.1 million people are registered to vote for a new state parliament in Brandenburg, the state that surrounds Berlin, the capital of Germany.\nSunday's election is being watched closely for signs about the country's political direction.\nThe latest polls showed the far-right Alternative for Germany neck-and-neck with the Social Democrats, the party that has governed Brandenburg continuously since German reunification in 1990.\nThe Social Democrats, the largest party in Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-way coalition government, are hoping to maintain control of their stronghold in the face of rising support for parties on the extreme right and left.\nIf the Social Democrats lose in Brandenburg, where Scholz himself has his constituency, it would be seen as a bad sign for him a year before federal elections are due to be held.\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany won the most votes and also did well in Saxony on elections held on Sept. 1, generating concerns in Germany and abroad about growing support for the extreme right in the largest European Union country.\nThe far-right party has gained support amid a growing backlash to large-scale migration to Germany over the past decade and several recent extremist attacks.",

Wearing a pink dirndl dress she'd bought just a few hours earlier, O'Halloran was surrounded by tens of thousands of other \u2014 likely more experienced \u2014 beer-drinkers for the first of 16 days of the 189th Oktoberfest in Munich.\nThe revelers celebrated Saturday to mark the official opening of the world's largest folk festival. Mayor Dieter Reiter started the celebration at noon when he inserted the tap into the first beer keg.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nServers immediately began ferrying beers \u2014 each carrying up to 10 glass mugs \u2014 across the packed tents. Guests started clinking their mugs and taking deep gulps of beer in the stuffy heat inside as bands played traditional Bavarian folk music. But plaques reminded them not to dance on the tables.\nThe festival runs through Oct. 6 in 18 large tents covering the Theresienwiese fairground. About 6 million visitors are expected over the festival's 16 days \u2014 up to 600,000 each day \u2014 and can expect to shell out between 13.60 and 15.30 euros ($15.12 to $17.01) for a big mug of beer. This year's prices are roughly 3.87% more than in 2023.\nThis year also includes stepped-up security in the wake of a deadly knife attack in Solingen, a city roughly 470 kilometers (292 miles) northwest of Munich. The violence on Aug. 23 left three people dead and eight more wounded, and the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack, without citing evidence. As a result, organizers added metal detectors to the security procedures for the first time in Oktoberfest's history, but said there were no concrete threats.\nEarly Saturday, revelers sprinted through the fairgrounds at 9 a.m. as soon as the entrances opened, despite security officers' attempts to keep the procession orderly. They laughed despite the morning chill \u2014 someone could be heard shrieking 'why are we running!' \u2014 and raced to get in line again, but this time to be first inside the tents and claim their tables.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nAfter a traditional parade and Reiter's ceremonial keg-tapping, festivalgoers inside and outside the tents turned their attention to beer and food, with roasted chicken, bratwurst and pretzels being among the most popular. Amusement park rides offered entertainment for young merrymakers who had journeyed to the fairgrounds with their parents.\nLike many others there on Saturday, Mikael Caselitz, 24, was born and raised in Munich and has attended Oktoberfest for years. He said everyone should travel to the city for the festival at least once in their lives.\n'It can get really crowded and disgusting when people puke on the side of the road,' he joked, 'but overall it's a really fun experience.'\nOllie Standen woke up at 6 a.m. to get in line well ahead of the noon keg-tapping. The 21-year-old from England is in Munich this year for a university exchange program and a local friend told him he had to join the festivities. He said he's looking forward to trying different German beers that aren't usually found in the United Kingdom.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\n'It's a great German tradition and I'm excited to be here,' he said.\nThe event was skipped in 2020 and 2021 as authorities grappled with COVID-19, but returned in 2022.\nThe first Oktoberfest was held on Oct. 17, 1810 to celebrate the marriage of Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria to Theresa of Saxony. The venue, a meadow on the edge of Munich at the time, was called 'Theresienwiese' to honor the bride. While that name remains, the start date has moved up to September, when the temperatures in Bavaria are usually warmer.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad",

The students were given an introduction about AMMWEC and had the opportunity to interact with members of the organization, including AMMWEC intern, Stella Hitch, gaining valuable insights into the work being done by AMMWEC to empower women and promote interfaith understanding.

It is heartening to see the enthusiasm and passion they have for promoting diversity and collaboration. We hope that this visit will inspire them to continue working towards creating a more inclusive and peaceful world.'\nAMMWEC executive Soraya Deen, also CEO of Muslim Women Speakers welcomed the young people. She emphasized the importance of American and German youth working together to curb the rising tide of antisemitism and extremism. 'In a world rocked by hate, it takes. it takes commitment and tenacity to explore the reasons for such hate,' she added, \" Frederick Douglass once said-\" It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men.'\nYouth Bridge held that promise to the world.\nAMMWEC continues to work towards its mission of empowering women and promoting interfaith understanding through various initiatives and events.

            "summary": "BERLIN, Sept 22 (Reuters) - The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is predicted to come first in an election in Brandenburg on Sunday, seeking to build on gains in other eastern states this month and beat Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats in a traditional stronghold.\nThe AfD became the first far-right party to win a state election in Germany since World War Two, in Thuringia, on Sept. 1 and just missed first place in Saxony.\nIt is one of several far-right groups in Europe capitalising on worries over an economic slowdown, immigration and the Ukraine war - concerns that are particularly strong in formerly Communist-run eastern Germany.\nThe party, which is unlikely to be able to govern because it is polling short of a majority and other parties would refuse to work with it, is also seeking to gain from discontent over infighting in Scholz's three-party federal coalition.\n\"We urgently need a thorough course correction so the country does not go to the dogs,\" the AfD's lead candidate in Brandenburg, Hans-Christoph Berndt, said at a campaign event earlier this month.\nAn AfD victory in the state election would be a particular embarrassment for the Social Democrats (SPD), which has won elections in Brandenburg and governed the state of 2.5 million people since reunification in 1990.\nIt would also raise further questions about the suitability of Scholz, the least popular German chancellor on record, to lead the party into next year's election.\nBrandenburg's popular SPD premier Dietmar Woidke has mostly shunned campaigning with Scholz, who lives in the state's capital, Potsdam. In an unusual move, Woidke has also criticised the behaviour and policies of the ruling coalition.\nInstead, he has sought to highlight economic success stories during the five years since the last state election such as the opening of a Tesla (TSLA.O), opens new tab factory and Brandenburg airport - which serves Berlin and is now Germany's third most important aviation hub.\nNARROW THE GAP\nIn recent weeks, the SPD has managed to narrow the gap with the AfD, opinion polls have shown.\nA poll published by pollster Forschungsgruppe Wahlen on Thursday put the AfD on 28% in Brandenburg with the SPD just one point behind on 27%, followed by the conservatives on 14% and the new leftist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) on 13%.\n\"My greatest challenge in this legislative period ... to not allow right-wing extremists to have anything to say in this country ever again,\" Woidke said at a campaign event on Tuesday.\nHe has threatened to resign if his party comes in behind the AfD. AfD party leader Tino Chrupalla said Scholz should do the same.\n\"It is high time this government suffer the consequences after this state election,\" Chrupalla said.\nBoth of Scholz's junior coalition partners, the Free Democrats and the Greens, look set to struggle to win the 5% needed to enter the state parliament, polls show.\nAt a national level, the three parties in Scholz's coalition are now collectively polling less than the opposition conservatives although political analysts say much could change before the federal election due in September 2025.",

            "excerpt": "Ballot being seen as referendum on Olaf Scholz's government ahead of next autumn's general election",
            "summary": "The far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party is hoping to come top in an election in the German state of Brandenburg on Sunday, three weeks after making historical gains in two other regions.\nThe AfD, which has been classified as rightwing extremist in several states by domestic intelligence agencies, is running almost neck and neck with Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD) in the state, a belt of urban and rural communities that surrounds the capital, Berlin.\nFinal polls showed the AfD to have a very slight lead on 28%, with the SPD having considerably narrowed the gap in the last days of campaigning to reach 27%. The conservative CDU was polling at 14% and the new leftist conservative Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) at 13%.\nThe Greens and the pro-business FDP, junior partners in Scholz's increasingly fractious three-way coalition, will struggle to win the 5% needed to enter the state parliament, as will the far-left Die Linke, according to polls.\nAbout 2.1 million people, including 100,000 first-time voters, are registered to vote, after the voting age was reduced to 16.\nThe ballot is being seen as a referendum on the federal government \u2013 the popularity ratings of which are at a record low \u2013 and a harbinger of the outcome of next autumn's federal election.\nThe SPD has ruled in the state since reunification 34 years ago, and was the party of all three of the leaders who have governed in that time.\nThe SPD's Dietmar Woidke, who has led Brandenburg for 14 years, has pledged to resign if the AfD beats his party, in what has been interpreted as a high-stakes gamble based on his own popularity as 'father of the state'. The AfD has also called for Scholz to resign.\nIn a humiliating gesture to Germany's leader, Woidke has not only criticised the federal government in his campaign, he has also completely excluded Scholz from it. The most unpopular chancellor on record has been barred from appearing at SPD rallies in the state, even though he and his wife, Britta Ernst, live in its capital, Potsdam.\nAlthough one of Germany's smallest states, population-wise, the outcome of the vote is being seen as significant for the whole country, and the results are being awaited with suspense across the continent.\nOn 1 September, the AfD became the strongest party in a state election for the first time in the eastern state of Thuringia, where it secured about 33% of the vote. In neighbouring Saxony, it emerged in second place, at about 30%, narrowly beaten by the governing centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU).\nThe campaign has focused on issues of immigration, energy transition, fears of economic recession and Germany's support for Ukraine, all of which are hot button issues in the former communist-run eastern Germany in particular, with the AfD proving itself to be especially adept at tuning into voters' concerns.\nEven if the AfD wins, it is unlikely to be able to rule the state, because it will lack a majority. The other parties have put up a so-called 'firewall' and have refused to work with it.\nThe BSW of Wagenknecht, a nine-month old breakaway group from the far-left Die Linke, is therefore likely to be a powerful element in any post-election power-broking.\nCritics say the firewall is going to prove to be increasingly hard to maintain if the AfD continues to perform strongly in elections.\nNationally, all three parties in Scholz's coalition are together polling less than the opposition CDU under Friedrich Merz, who this month was formally appointed as the party's chancellor candidate for the federal election on 28 September 28, 2025.",

            "summary": "Sept 21 (Reuters) - British actor Stephen Fry has praised Austria for welcoming him as a citizen and giving him the right to vote in the country's upcoming election following a change in the law that sought to address Austria's crimes under Nazism.\nIn 2019, the Austrian parliament passed a bill making descendants of Austrians who fled Nazi rule eligible for citizenship, a step which Fry told newspaper Der Standard was a \"noble gesture\" in an interview published on Saturday.\nFry, one of Britain's best-known actors and TV broadcasters, said this month in a video on social media that he had obtained citizenship because he had grandparents from Austria and that his great-grandparents had died in the Holocaust.\nAfter thanking Austria for changing the law and urging others to vote in the Sept. 29 parliamentary election, Fry said: \"I am so proud to be Austrian.\"\nAustria became part of Nazi Germany in 1938 following its annexation by Adolf Hitler, who was born in Austria.\nReferring to Britain's exit from the European Union, the 67-year-old Fry told Der Standard that becoming an EU citizen again had enabled him to \"to stick my tongue out at Brexit\", according to the German text of his interview.\nThis month's election will be the first time that thousands of people who took advantage of the law changes allowing them to become dual nationals can vote in an Austrian general election.\nAbout 33,000 people have acquired that right over the last four years, according to the Austrian government.\nThe election looks set to be very close, with the opposition far-right Freedom Party (FPO) running just ahead of the ruling conservative Austrian People's Party (OVP) in opinion polls. No party is expected to win an outright majority.\nThe legislation to change Austrian citizenship rules was put forward by an OVP-FPO coalition before that government unravelled in 2019 due to an influence-peddling scandal. It was passed during the ensuing caretaker administration.\nFry, who rose to fame in comedy shows such as \"Blackadder\" and \"Jeeves and Wooster\", did not reveal who he was voting for, but mentioned the rising support for the right.\n\"You hear that right-wing forces are growing again in Germany and then wonder whether Austria is also moving in the same direction,\" said Fry, who according to his website once joined Britain's centre-left Labour Party. \"It's a story that's being watched all over the world.\"",

            "summary": "An artwork depicting acclaimed artist David Hockney is to be rehung in Bradford's new city centre market. The portrait of the famous Bradford-born painter, which is made entirely of nails, will be placed on the top floor of the Darley Street Market.Created by Shipley-based artist Marcus Levine, the artwork was completed in 2017 to mark Hockney's 80th birthday. For seven years it hung in the Little Germany area of the city, before being reinstalled in its new home.\nMr Levine said that the portrait had been \"one of the biggest creative challenges\" of his artistic career. The portrait only features the primary colours of red, blue and yellow.But the way they are combined makes it appear from a distance as if a full spectrum of colours has been used.\n\"Up close, it appears as an abstract nail sculpture, but as you step back, everything comes into focus,\" Mr Levine said.He said he was \"thrilled\" it had been moved to the new building.\"Even more people will be able to enjoy it, and as people will now be able to get closer up to the piece, they will be able to see how it's been put together.\"Bradford Council's executive member for regeneration Alex Ross-Shaw said: \"I first met Marcus a few years ago and suggested to him that Darley Street Market would be a fitting home for this amazing artwork and I'm delighted that it's now happened and will be enjoyed and appreciated by thousands of visitors to the market for many years to come.\"\nWell-known for his vivid and colourful prints of rolling hills and countryside settings, Hockney is considered one of most influential British artists of the 20th Century. His portrait will greet visitors to the Darley Street market when it opens early next year after a \u00a327m development.

He once again repaid manager Vincent Kompany's faith as he was heavily involved in Bayern's attack.\nBayern, who have scored 20 goals in three matches across all competitions, opened the scoring in the 23rd minute when Harry Kane seized possession on the edge of the area and played the ball to Olise, who fired his shot past keeper Michael Zetterer.\nThe French winger then wriggled his way into Bremen's penalty area in the 32nd minute and his cutback was turned home by Musiala.\nBayern continued their onslaught after the break and Olise teed up Kane for a shot from the edge of the box, which led to the striker's 41st Bundesliga goal - making him the highest-scoring English player in the German top flight's history.\nOlise netted his fifth goal in three matches with a delightful sidefooted finish into the top corner and substitute Serge Gnabry wrapped up the scoring in the 65th minute.\nBayern were without veteran goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, who was named in the starting lineup before pulling out after the warm-up due to a thigh injury, but the change made little difference.\nDeputy Sven Ulreich was untroubled throughout the match and faced no shots on target from a toothless Bremen attack.\nBayern stepped off the gas in the last 15 minutes of the match, likely saving energy for a testing clash against champions Bayer Leverkusen on Sept. 28.",

We have to respect tradition as well.\n\"We're going to go to Oktoberfest and we've got to have a bit of fun as well and then as of Monday, it'll all be about Leverkusen, the preparation for this game.\"\nThe one-sided win over Bremen took Bayern's tally for the past week up to 20 goals, with Kompany's side scoring six in a league win over newly-promoted Holstein Kiel last Saturday before demolishing Dinamo Zagreb 9-2 in a midweek Champions League clash.\n\"I'm very happy. It was important to prepare well for this tricky game,\" the Belgian manager said.\n\"The boys did really well. For us the pressure is always there to win and play well.

It was simply a good game for us.\"\nMichael Olise, signed from Premier League club Crystal Palace for a reported fee of 60 million euros ($66.97 million) in July, scored two goals and set up two more in the win.\nKompany praised the French winger's performance, adding: \"He's a special talent. It's a luxury at Bayern to have so many good players. Michael did very well.\n\"His start at Bayern couldn't be much better. He has to keep going this way. I haven't got the feeling that he's a player who feels much pressure. He just enjoys football.\"",

            "excerpt": "With slogans and in social-media posts, the former president has dribbled out ideas that, together, would fundamentally change how taxes are collected in the U.S.",
            "summary": "At the start of the summer, when former President Donald J. Trump visited Republicans on Capitol Hill, he hinted at a vision for a vastly different tax system than what the United States has employed for decades.\nRather than taxing Americans on the money they earn at their jobs and on their investments, Mr. Trump instead suggested imposing a broad tax on the goods that Americans buy from abroad. In his view, such tariffs could replace income taxes as the main source of federal revenue.\nThe idea, briefly floated behind closed doors, seemed to fizzle, and Mr. Trump did not publicly repeat it as experts questioned whether such a model would even be possible. But in the weeks since, Mr. Trump has floated ideas that, taken together, would fundamentally change the way Americans are taxed, eroding the income tax while embracing expansive tariffs as a way to raise federal revenue.\nTwo of his proposals \u2014 no taxes on tips and no taxes on overtime \u2014 could open gaping loopholes in the income tax, luring Americans of all stripes to change how they earn money to avoid taxes. He has also called for ending taxes on Social Security benefits and fully restoring a costly deduction for state and local taxes \u2014 all on top of a push to extend tax cuts he signed into law in 2017, many of which expire after next year.\n'The joke is maybe over the next two weeks he'll get all the way there, and he'll have fully eliminated the income tax with all of his proposals,' said Erica York, an analyst at the Tax Foundation, which generally favors lower taxes. 'All of these little policies we're seeing is one industry, one type of income at a time working his way toward that.'\nHis ideas \u2014 if they all became law, far from a sure thing in Washington \u2014 would in effect move the United States closer to a taxation system used in many other countries. Most advanced economies, including Canada, Germany and Japan, collect value-added taxes, essentially a national sales taxes on goods and services. The United States is unique for not having such a tax. Many economists generally support so-called consumption taxes, which they view as an efficient and hard-to-evade way of collecting money for the government.",

            "summary": "Not long ago, candidates running for national office spent much of the general election distancing themselves from the fringes of their parties.\nBut on Saturday, Senator JD Vance of Ohio will share a stage with someone on the fringes of his.\nMr. Vance, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, is scheduled to appear in Hershey, Pa., as the special guest of the 'Tucker Carlson Live' show, just weeks after Mr. Carlson, the former Fox News anchor, praised and aired the views of Darryl Cooper, who falsely claimed that the Holocaust was not an intentional act of genocide.\nMr. Carlson described Mr. Cooper as 'the best and most honest popular historian in the United States.' In Mr. Carlson's interview with him, which was posted on social media this month, Mr. Cooper falsely claimed that the Nazis' systematic killing of European Jews was an accident of history carried out by a German military overwhelmed with prisoners of war \u2014 not an act of premeditated genocide. In fact, the Nazis' killing of almost six million Jews was meticulously planned and documented.\nMr. Cooper also called Winston Churchill, the British prime minister, 'the chief villain of the Second World War' for declaring war on Germany after the Nazis invaded Poland.\nMr. Carlson's promotion of Mr. Cooper drew criticism from the Biden White House and from some conservatives.\nA Vance campaign spokesman said this month that Mr. Vance did not share the views of Mr. Cooper but 'doesn't believe in guilt-by-association cancel culture. '\nMr. Vance has defended his decision to keep his interview with Mr. Carlson, saying that Republicans believe in free speech and debate. 'Tucker Carlson is not affiliated with the campaign, so I don't think what Tucker Carlson does is a distraction or is not,' Mr. Vance said this month. 'He's going to do what he wants to do, and we can disagree or agree with the viewpoints.'\nTickets for the events ranged from $35 for upper-level seats to $1,600 for a 'V.I.P. Meet and Greet Experience' that included access to a reception with Mr. Vance, a photo with Mr. Carlson and a seat in the first five rows.\nMr. Carlson is in the midst of his first live tour, a national, monthlong run of shows with some of the most well-known and controversial figures in conservative politics. His guests have included Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point Action, and media personalities such as Glenn Beck and Dan Bongino.\nLater this month, Mr. Carlson will be joined by Alex Jones, a conspiracy theorist who has been ordered to pay over $1.4 billion in defamation damages to the families of the victims of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012; Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia; and Donald Trump Jr., the former president's eldest child and the host of the podcast 'Triggered.'",

            "excerpt": "Nvidia looks set to end production of the RTX 4090 which could mean supply shortages in the run up to Christmas of the world's fastest gaming graphics card",
            "summary": "Nvidia looks set to discontinue production of its flagship GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card range next month to set the scene for an expected RTX 5000 launch including an RTX 5090 and likely RTX 5080 in late 2024 or early 2025. (Wccftech The move is expected to allow add in board (AIB) partners to clear stock of the now two year old model, but could result in shortages of the highly desirable high-end graphics card in the lead up to Christmas as supplies run dry.\nNvidia's GeForce RTX 4090\nDespite it's high price, which still sees most variations from board partners such as Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and Palit rarely dip much below $2,000, The RTX 4090 still sells well making up one percent of the Steam Hardware Survey's count of GPUs, with that count having risen over the last three months and eclipsing that of the RTX 4080. That is likely thanks to the RTX 4080 being discontinued after the RTX 4080 Super launched earlier this year.\nIn the past Nvidia has opted to launch is recent GPUs between summer and Christmas, though, so unless some other forces are at play that force the company's hand to going with an early 2025 launch instead, a pre Christmas launch would definitely fit with the usual launch windows as well as giving the PC hardware community something else to look forward to in the run up to end of the year.\nThis would also be a useful coalition of upgrade potential thanks to Intel and AMD launching new processors and motherboards starting from October. AMD will see X870 chipset motherboards hitting shelves that month with its highly anticipated Ryzen 9000X3D CPUs expected around January. Intel meanwhile, as well as releasing its new Lunar Lake mobile CPUs, which impressed at their launch in Germany recently, will also be fully announcing its desktop Arrow Lake-S processors.\nThese will use a new CPU socket and require DDR5 memory, but it's hoped that Intel can avoid AMD's lacklustre Ryzen 9000 launch, which was marred by delays and disappointing performance as well as Windows fixes. It's an important time of year for all three companies, then, although indications are that AMD will likely not be joining the race for the flagship gaming graphics card crown and will instead be focussing on the mid-range in a similar way to we've seen it do in the past, for example with the RX 5700 XT. This can help to lower costs and afterall, even the mighty RTX 4090 only accounts for one percent of the Steam Hardware Survey GPU count.\nThe RTX 5000 series will be based on Nvidia's Blackwell architecture using a rumored refined rather than entirely new manufacturing process called N4P. The Blackwell desktop GPU architecture should see a significant boost to transistor count, and could also make the move to PCIe 5 where motherboard support beckons, even if this will not likely see any significant benefits.\nFor more PC news and reviews including those for AMD, Intel and Nvidia's upcoming launches, don't forget to follow me here on Forbes using the blue button below, on Facebook or my YouTube channel.",

And they told me to get up and get ready in ten minutes.\"And at that moment, I was absolutely certain that I was being led out to be executed.\"But instead of the nearby wood, they took me to the airport, handcuffed with a prison convoy, boarded me on a plane and flew me to Moscow.'Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and former US Marine Paul Whelan were also released by Russia in the exchange.In the West, Russian security service hitman Vadim Krasikov was freed by Germany along with others elsewhere accused of intelligence activities.\nThe US, Norway, Poland and Slovenia also participated in what was the biggest swap since the Cold War between the West and Russia ended more than 30 years ago.On Friday, Mr Kara-Murza met prime minister Sir Keir Starmer and Foreign Secretary David Lammy - and he is now urging Western governments to give stronger backing to Ukraine.He is pushing for the release of thousands of other political prisoners who are still being held in Putin's jails.In their interview, to be broadcast on BBC One on Sunday at 9am, he and his wife talk about their reunion, their family and the moment they tasted freedom.Mrs Kara Murza talks of her 'immense joy' at having her husband back and seeing him with their three children.\"Having survived two assassination attempts and now this prison sentence, including eleven months in solitary confinement in horrendous conditions, he's yet again alive and relatively healthy with us,\" she said.Watch the full interview on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg on BBC One and iPlayer at 9am.",

            "summary": "PayPal is enhancing its footprint in the crypto sector, now enabling U.S. users to purchase over 110 different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, through a partnership with MoonPay. This collaboration aims to simplify and secure the crypto-buying process. Amid these developments, Bitcoin's value surged to $65,000 following a Federal Reserve hint at lowering interest rates but later fell to $60,000.\nConcurrently, BlockDAG is making significant strides by collaborating with two prominent European soccer clubs and possibly a Premier League club soon, leveraging these partnerships to amplify its growth and build on a successful $73.7 million presale.\nExpanding PayPal Crypto Payments in the U.S.\nEarlier this year, PayPal rolled out a feature allowing U.S. users to buy over 110 cryptocurrencies directly through their accounts by collaborating with Miami-based MoonPay. This move underscored PayPal's commitment to more deeply integrate crypto transactions within its services.\nBy June, this feature was available in Europe and the U.K., broadening the accessibility of PayPal's crypto services and boosting user trust. Ivan Soto-Wright, CEO of MoonPay, highlighted the simplicity and reliability of this service. PayPal now trails only Apple Pay and bank transfers in popularity in the U.S., signaling a shift toward broader acceptance of digital currencies.\nBitcoin's Value Drops After Federal Reserve's Warning\nBitcoin's value increased last week when Jerome Powell, head of the Federal Reserve, suggested interest rates might be cut in September. This news pushed Bitcoin's price to $65,000, seen as a prime opportunity for gains. However, following this surge, Bitcoin's price dropped to about $60,000, coinciding with another cryptocurrency's significant crash.\nWith the Federal Reserve's new warning about potential economic measures, experts anticipate substantial shifts for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Another warning from the Fed indicates a possible major turn in the crypto market.\nBlockDAG Poised for Big Moves with Premier League Club Deal\nBlockDAG is making waves in the crypto world by teaming up with some of Europe's favorite soccer clubs. With partnerships like Inter Milan and Borussia Dortmund, BlockDAG is redefining how crypto initiatives interact with sports.\nInter Milan's collaboration with BlockDAG marks its entry into blockchain alliances, while Borussia Dortmund landed Germany's biggest crypto sponsorship of $10 million. These partnerships boost BlockDAG's visibility with eye-catching advertisements and social media buzz during soccer matches.\nThe buzz doesn't end there. There's talk that BlockDAG might soon partner with a Premier League club. Such a move could stir up excitement in both sports and crypto circles. Leveraging its previous successful partnerships, BlockDAG aims to elevate its presale, which has already gathered $73.7 million from enthusiastic supporters. BlockDAG is clearly in the game to score big, merging the excitement of soccer with the innovative sphere of cryptocurrency.\nThese partnerships are proving to be a game-changer. BlockDAG connects with the vast, enthusiastic fan bases of these soccer clubs, reaching millions of potential new crypto users. These efforts do more than just increase visibility; they accelerate BlockDAG's expansion across Europe and cement its status as a top pick for crypto traders in 2024.\nWho's Leading the Next Crypto Wave?\nAs PayPal extends its crypto services across the U.S. and Europe, and Bitcoin fluctuates in response to Federal Reserve signals, BlockDAG emerges as a standout. With partnerships with soccer leaders like Inter Milan and Borussia Dortmund and potential ties with a Premier League club, BlockDAG's presale has soared to $73.7 million. Market analysts speculate that BlockDAG's next strategic move could set a new course in the crypto market.\nJoin BlockDAG:",

            "excerpt": "It's the end of the road for the Nissan GT-R R35 which will go out of production next month. But there is a successor...and it's electric!",
            "summary": "After a 17-run the GT-R will go out of production in 2024.\nAt the time of its launch in 2007, Nissan's GT-R R35 was faster around the famed Nurburgring in Germany than a Porsche 911 Turbo. In a recent sprint from zero to 60-mph by Car and Driver the latest iteration of the GT-R posted a super quick time of 2.9 seconds.\nWhen BBC Top Gear's former host James May tested the ballistic GT-R around a decade ago, he said it was 'literally, the most amazing car in the world.' His co-host, controversial motoring hack Jeremy Clarkson said of the supercar game-changer, 'They haven't built a new car. Nissan has built a new yardstick!'\nWell, after a 17-year run, and around ten different updates, the GT-R is finally going out of production with strong rumors that it will be replaced with a totally reinvented 1,300-hp fully electric GT-R. More on that later.\nThat's right, in October this year, the GT-R R35 will disappear from Nissan's lineup in the U.S. And to celebrate the end of an era, Japan's third biggest carmaker is going out in style by offering hardcore fans access to two special edition models.\nThe GT-R will go out in style through two special edition models.\nWith a hand-crafted 565-hp twin turbocharged 3.8-liter V6, four-wheel-drive, four-wheel-steer, 6-piston Brembo brakes, multiple race victories in half a dozen countries, and a launch control from hell, the GT-R is truly a one of a kind.\nThe new GT-R T-spec celebrates the specially curated editions of the GT-R over the years, while the GT-R T-spec Takumi Edition honors the artisans who put their hearts and souls into every model, hand-building the complex V6 engines. Enthusiasts will appreciate the NISMO carbon-ceramic brakes, fitted as standard, and gold-painted 20-inch NISMO RAYS forged wheels, the NISMO-tuned Vehicle Dynamic Control, and wider front fenders.\nThe GT-R may not have been a big seller in the U.S., only selling around 13,700 units since 2007, but it's what the Nissan supercar has achieved in racing and movie and gaming culture that makes it so special. The GT-R won the 2015 Blancpain Endurance title in Europe and well as numerous Super GT championships in Japan while it became a hugely popular sports car in the world's biggest selling driving game Gran Turismo in addition to starring in the Fast and Furious movie series.\nThe GT-R won the 2015 Blancpain Endurance PRO driver's title.\nJust after it was launched, it quickly became the new standard for super-fast acceleration, handling and cost performance. The Takumi Edition goes for around $151,000 today, but 17 years ago, you could get a new 480-hp GT-R for $69,850. There was no other supercar for that price that offered such power and handling. And now, it's time to shelve the aging supercar.\nThe curtain may be coming down on the current GT-R, but that doesn't mean the game-changing coupe will vanish completely. Nissan has constantly hinted at a successor, and the big 'aha!' moment came a year ago when the brand unveiled its edgy electric Hyper Force concept at the Tokyo Mobility Show. Boasting the latest solid-state batteries and triple electric motors, the next-gen GT-R is said to generate 1000 kW or 1,341-hp.\nThe Hyper Force concept shown at last year's Japan Mobility Show.\nIn a recent interview, Nissan senior vice president Francois Bailly, confirmed the development of a next-generation GT-R R36. A fully electric GT-R, based heavily on the Hyper Force, would enter the lineup as a 'halo car,' showcasing the brand's next-generation EV technology, including game-changing solid-state batteries.\nA potential launch date however is hard to pin down. Nissan plans to introduce solid-state batteries into production cars in 2028, so an electric GT-R replacement may be at least four years off.",

            "summary": "Mercedes-Maybach S680 luxury sedan. (Photo by Sjoerd van)\nMercedes is the latest German auto giant to cut its profit forecast, flailing against a weakening European market, more competition in China, and struggling sales of electric vehicles.\nGerman carmakers will have to seek collaboration deals with Chinese manufacturers to bridge the technology gap, one analyst said.\nMercedes cuts its profit forecast for 2024 to a range of 7.5 to 8.5%, from a previous expectation of up to 11%. Earlier in September BMW slashed its profit forecast to as low as 6% compared with its previous estimate of 8 to 10%.\nInvestment researcher Jefferies, in a report entitled 'Stormy Weather at Mercedes', said the cut was not unexpected, but the scale of it was.\nInvestors seemed less irked by BMW's decision because it was linked to a single, quantifiable problem \u2013 a 1.5 million vehicle recall to fix faulty brakes - but BMW also warned about deteriorating conditions in China.\nMulti-brand Volkswagen is feeling the pressure and has been forced to consider closing factories for the first time in its 87-year history. VW needs to radically increase its sales of EVs next year or face big fines for offending the European Union's carbon dioxide emissions rules.\nGlobalData has been relentlessly cutting its sales forecast for Western Europe. Four months ago it was forecasting just under 5% growth. Its latest forecast says there will be a slight contraction with sales falling 0.4% compared with last year, as the total for 2024 peaks out at 11.51 million.\nAccording to Professor Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research (CAR), German automakers have been asleep at the switch and fallen behind in the development of EVs, their batteries and software. Governments have made the problem worse.\n'China is increasingly becoming the biggest test of the last 50 years. More than half of new cars in China are electric (it's well under 20% in Europe). Germany and Europe have missed this. Industrial policy in Berlin and Brussels has exacerbated the problem,' Dudenhoeffer said in a statement assessing the Mercedes profit warning after similar action at BMW, and VW's restructuring plan.\nDudenhoeffer said the Chinese market's huge scale \u2013 1.3 million EVs will be sold in Europe this year, compared with around 7 million in China \u2013 means Chinese EV makers have a huge cost advantage.\n'Politicians in Brussels and Berlin have squandered our home advantage,' Dudenhoeffer said.\nThe Mercedes-Benz S-class cabriolet. (Photo credit DANIEL ROLAND/AFP via Getty Images)\nThe Financial Times Lex column said upmarket German automakers are having a bad time in China where an ailing property market has curbed spending on top-of-the-range vehicles like the Mercedes S-Class and Maybach. Prices for the Maybach in Europe start close to $200,000 after tax.\nLex doesn't see much chance of an economic revival in China.\n'There's little hope of a real estate revival in China. And the competition in electric vehicles and combustion engine cars may even increase as growth slows. Moreover, if the European Union goes ahead with plans to slap import levies on Chinese EVs, then the higher-end cars that Mercedes ships to China, like the Maybach, could suffer from counter-tariffs. The road ahead looks treacherous,' Lex said.\nThe same reasoning applies to BMW, and VW's Audi, Porsche, Bentley and Lamborghini subsidiaries.\nInvestment researcher Bernstein, in a report entitled 'Mercedes - China weakness triggers another profit warning', said Mercedes seemed a bit tentative compared with BMW.\n'Mercedes was cautious not to provide any updates on 2025 or beyond, simply saying that they would provide an update later in the year. However, this is in stark contrast to BMW, which clearly stated that they expect to return to their strategic margin corridor by 2025,' the report said.\nDudenhoeffer said German automakers need to take a couple of strategic decisions. They must spend more money on their businesses in China to bridge the costs gap, and seek partnerships to narrow the technology gap.\n'The only thing that German manufacturers can do is to invest even more in China to build up and expand development centers and production for electric cars. EV technology comes from China now and it has a 'natural competitive advantage. Just as we have natural competitive advantage with the combustion engine.'\n'Even more cooperation with China, even more cooperation with suppliers and car manufacturers is the only way to make up the lost ground,' Dudenhoeffer said.",

While these will delight, they all arrive with an air of disappointment.\nCustomers try out the latest iPhone 16 models at an Apple store (Photo by Anusak Laowilas/NurPhoto ...

The display can go a little dimmer and a little brighter as required.

The Action Button is now available over all four iPhone 16 models, and a second capacitive button has been added. The Camera Control button acts as a shutter button, but thanks to its capacitive nature, it can offer a multitude of functions, all accessible under a single finger.\nThis includes controls for exposure and depth of field, along with photo filters, zoom, and switching between photo and video modes. There's no doubt that the camera control button is a welcome addition to the interface. Forbes contributor David Phelan picks out this one change as a game-changer for the shutterbugs:\n\"There's a learning curve here, but it's shallow and easily managed. And the results are terrific\u2014this is easily the best way to shoot video and stills on an iPhone, with perfect placing of the button and fast and responsive mechanics in the Control itself.\"\nThe camera control button is one of the delights of the new iPhone design, but it's arguably the only significant addition to the package. Does one button make a banquet?\nApple CEO Tim Cook (C) poses for selfies with customers during Apple's iPhone 16 launch (Photo by ... [+] TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty Images)\nThere is, of course, one elephant in the smartphone room that is revolutionising the space. The use of generative artificial intelligence.\nThe iPhone 16 family has been heralded as the first to be built for Apple Intelligence. The use of generative AI in smartphones burst into the public consciousness with the Google Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro in October 2023, and the second generation of the software launched in August 2024.\nSince then, Apple's generative AI system\u2014the clunkily backronymed Apple Intelligence\u2014has been presented to the press twice by Apple, first at June's Worldwide Developer Conference and then at the launch of the iPhone 16 family itself. Yet, it is still not available for public release.\nThe first hints of generative AI will be added to iOS in the v18.1 update due in October, with the addition of the iconic ChatGPT not happening until December, and the core functionality, as seen across the Android platform, may arrive by March 2025.\nThe most significant innovation in the smartphone space will not be available to iPhone users until Spring next year. In that same window, the majority of Android users will have seen not only the full suite of first-generation generative AI but will have received the updated second-generation software.\nEven with the most generous reading of the 'Apple is not first, but Apple is the best' mythic storytelling, Apple has missed the boat on AI and is struggling to catch up.\nPeople seen testing their new iPhones during the launching of the new iPhone 16 and 16 Pro (Photo by ... [+] Faris Hadziq/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\nAI has changed the smartphone game and Apple promises that Apple Intelligence will do that when it finally arrives. For now, it is impossible to judge if Tim Cook and his team have called it correctly.\nThe Camera Control button has improved the camera game. Yet, it would be remiss not to mention that the software on this is not ready either, and key features (such as a half-press to hold focus) are expected in a later update, but Apple has not offered a timescale.\nFinally, the Top Trumps styled raising of each specification by a few percentage points each year brings us more battery life, brighter screens, faster processors, and more memory.\nThere are moments of delight, the promise of more, and the allure of the Apple brand. Ultimately, the iPhone 16 Pro\u2014and the iPhone 16 family as a whole\u2014is little more than an iterative update on last year's iPhone 15 Pro.\nNow read more about Apple's decision to downgrade the iPhone 16 family in Europe...",

            "excerpt": "Millions have always known it and now scientists agree that for health and pleasure, less is more, says freelance journalist Elle Hunt",
            "summary": "What a great feeling it is when a study by actual scientists comes along and validates something that you've been saying for years. Researchers from the behaviour and health research unit at the University of Cambridge (heard of it?!) have recommended that the traditional British pint be abandoned in favour of the two-thirds measure.\nAfter a trial in a dozen pubs, bars and restaurants in England, the study leader, Prof Theresa Marteau, concluded that the change \u2013 which led to nearly 10% less beer being sold and consumed \u2013 could reduce the impact of alcohol-related harm.\nI'm entirely in favour of the idea, but only partly because of the potential benefits to population health. Ever since I moved to the UK in 2017, I've felt that the British pint is simply too big to comfortably enjoy. Even if you sip slowly, by the time you reach the bottom, you're inevitably left feeling sluggish and bloated because of the vast quantity of liquid you've consumed.\nIt's unwieldy to transport from the bar to the table and the final third is always warm, even if it wasn't served that way to start with. Then, if you're locked into a round, you're obliged to do it all over again.\nIt's no wonder Britain has a problem with alcohol: every time you agree to a quick pint \u2013 which, let's be honest, normally ends up as at least two \u2013 you're committing yourself to imbibing more than a litre of the stuff.\nOf course, you could always get a half, as one friend suggests. She recently switched to that as her standard order, and claims it's a gamechanger for painlessly moderating your alcohol intake. But I can't help but feel short-changed, handing over three quid for a drink that can be downed in two-and-a-half swigs, leaving you to wait for your companion to finish their monster pint.\nThe two-thirds pint is the perfect compromise: enough beer to feel you've got your money's worth, and can relax into the experience \u2013 but not so much that it leaves no room in your stomach for anything else.\nI developed a preference for the two-thirds pour while living in Sydney, where the 'schooner' is standard. I certainly wouldn't say that Australia has a more civilised drinking culture than Britain, or less alcohol-related harm: the sheer range of measures available (a schooner, a pot, a middy, a handle, a glass; some differing by state) speaks to beer's central importance.\nBut the widespread acceptance of smaller serves, in my experience, made for a better time at the pub. Coming in at a touch over two-thirds of a pint, I found that the standard 425ml schooner is the perfect volume of liquid for catching up with a friend, and creating a break from your day but not sending it off track. Even if you do go in for a second, you've still had less than one litre of beer.\nReally, when you think about it, 568ml is an obscene amount of liquid to consume in one sitting \u2013 and 1,136ml even more so. It probably wouldn't occur to you to drink more than half a litre of coffee, or milkshake, or kombucha at a time. So why is it the norm, in Britain, with beer \u2013 and despite the known harms?\nI know that I've looked askance at teenagers chugging from those bucket-sized cans of energy drinks and wondered what all that guarana must be doing to their systems. But with alcohol, we know only too well that it's nothing good. Even drinking in moderation isn't as harmless as we've been led to believe, with many of those findings reached by flawed methodology, and sometimes with funding from the alcohol industry.\nYou could argue, given the increasingly damning research, that reducing the standard measure by a third isn't going far enough: we should be abstaining from alcohol entirely. I don't foresee Britain ever becoming teetotal \u2013 but that doesn't mean there aren't changes that could be made, to reduce the harms of alcohol without encroaching on the pleasures.\nAt the Bear pub in Sheffield, which participated in the Cambridge study, punters generally stuck to two drinks rather than making up the difference with a third, suggesting it's the two-drink ritual that is important to British drinkers rather than the size of the glass. The experiment suggests that, with a relatively straightforward tweak, we can still enjoy the ritual of alcohol while avoiding some of the adverse effects.\nThe British pint is one of the largest standard servings in the world \u2013 bigger than those in Australia, Germany and the US. It has been that way since 1698, when a law was passed to prevent publicans from short-changing their customers with shorter measures. But now we know that more is not always better \u2013 especially in the case of alcohol. We might not be willing to give up drinking entirely, but certainly in Australia I was happy to settle for less.\nElle Hunt is a freelance journalist",

Of the five main classes of vertebrate animals, reptiles often inspire the most fear.\nBut reptiles deserve our sympathy \u2014 and conservation dollars \u2014 just as much as mammals, which may seem more charismatic. One in five reptile species are under threat.\nI'm trying to replace my own unease of these creatures with wonder. Reptiles are astonishingly diverse, with extraordinary adaptations such as a tiny lizard in Costa Rica that has evolved a way to 'scuba dive,' according to new research.\nFantastic creatures\nThe diving anole lives in Costa Rica's rainforest, where it's able to form small air bubbles atop its head as a source of oxygen when submerged. This ability allows the lizard to stay underwater for a prolonged period of time.\nThe unusual and specialized behavior, filmed by researchers as part of a new study, could help anoles hide from predators on land.\nThe wee anole relies mostly on camouflage to hide from predators such as birds, snakes, mammals and other lizards. And when camouflage fails, waiting out a threat underwater is an effective survival strategy.\nExplorations\nKaspar Hauser, an enigmatic man thought by some to be a 'lost prince,' died in 1833. Much less is known about his origin story.\nHauser appeared seemingly out of nowhere in what is now Nuremberg, Germany, on May 26, 1828, when he was about 16 years old. He was found wandering the town square with no identification and with an unsigned letter clutched in his hand.\nNearly 200 years later, scientists have used a new DNA analysis to solve a longstanding mystery about Hauser's suspected ties to royalty.\nAcross the universe\nSince 1977, NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft has been exploring the solar system and beyond.\nThe probe was the first spacecraft to cross the heliosphere \u2014 the sun's bubble of magnetic fields and particles that extends beyond planetary orbits \u2014 and venture into interstellar space, or space between stars. Along the way, Voyager 1 found a thin ring around Jupiter and two new Jovian moons as well as five new moons orbiting Saturn.\nNow, the space agency may have found a way to keep the 47-year-old probe communicating with Earth from billions of miles away.\nNASA engineers successfully fired up a set of thrusters Voyager 1 hasn't used in decades, which could help keep its antenna pointed at Earth.\nIn other space news, NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will be able to vote via absentee ballot from low-Earth orbit in November's election. The duo's stay aboard the International Space Station was extended until 2025 after arriving in June on a test flight of Boeing's troubled Starliner spacecraft. The trip was initially expected to last about eight days.\nTrailblazers\nA flooded quarry near Bristol, England, is a testing ground for a bold plan to develop an underwater habitat.\nThe goal of DEEP, a UK-based ocean technology company, is to build interconnected modules that would allow people to live and work at a depth of 656 feet (200 meters) for up to a month.\nA 40-by-25-foot (12-by-7.5-meter) habitat with enough space for three people to stay underwater for up to a week will be ready to go into the water at DEEP's UK campus in early 2025.\nThe company hopes that its habitats can achieve a permanent human presence underwater, akin to the International Space Station \u2014 which has allowed humans to live and work in space since 2000 \u2014 but for the ocean.\nThe wonder\nVincent van Gogh's masterpiece 'The Starry Night' is a beguiling work of art. It's also surprisingly scientifically accurate.\nA new analysis of the painting by physicists based in China and France suggests the artist had a deep, intuitive understanding of the mathematical structure of turbulent flow, a common natural phenomenon observed in fluids such as moving water, ocean currents and billowing storm clouds.\nThe scientists determined that the sizes of the 14 whorls or eddies in 'The Starry Night,' and their relative distance and intensity, follow a physical law that governs fluid dynamics known as Kolmogorov's theory of turbulence.\nThe physics hidden in Van Gogh's depiction of the night sky may be one reason why people are so drawn to the painting.\nCuriosities\n\u2014 A still-shiny bronze sword engraved with the name of King Ramses II in hieroglyphics has been unearthed in Egypt.\n\u2014 Helga and Zohar, two mannequins that flew aboard the Orion space capsule during the uncrewed Artemis I mission in 2022, are revealing how much radiation astronauts may experience on future Artemis missions.\n\u2014 The full harvest supermoon shone brightly in the night sky earlier this week. A partial lunar eclipse, with a 'bite' taken from the moon, was also visible to sky-gazers.\n\u2014 Earth will soon gain a new 'mini-moon,' a recently discovered asteroid named 2024 PT5.

            "summary": "Ursula von der Leyen was leaving nothing to chance. At a private meeting with members of the European parliament in Strasbourg last Tuesday, she chose not to reveal who would get what job in her incoming European Commission, due to take office at the end of the year.\nThen immediately afterwards, during a brisk 21-minute press conference, she announced every single name, leaving MEPs fuming. 'That's not how it should be done,' said one.\nThe secrecy around the big reveal is characteristic of von der Leyen, who carefully controls the flow of information. Named as the most powerful woman in the world by Forbes magazine and soon to start a second term as commission president, she has organised her new team in a way that is a lesson in how to amass control.\n'This is very like the divide and rule approach,' said Sophia Russack, a researcher at the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels.\nEU watchers have been poring over organisational charts of the new commission, drawing in lines of who reports to who. The answer is soon clear: all power flows to von der Leyen.\nThe 'presidentialisation' of the commission has been under way since the EU's 'big bang' enlargement in 2004 made the EU executive's top table far bigger, creating a need for more direction. Each of the 27 member states has a commissioner, a privilege none wants to give up. But von der Leyen has taken presidential power to another level.\nLast week, she oversaw the departure of one of her sharpest critics: French commissioner Thierry Breton, who had expected to return to Brussels for a second term after being nominated by France's president, Emmanuel Macron. Instead, after back channel talks between Macron and von der Leyen, Breton was out. He resigned, accusing her of 'questionable governance'.\nIn another show of strength, von der Leyen arm-twisted governments to send her female commissioner candidates, rewarding countries that complied (including Romania and Slovenia) with big jobs or impressive-sounding titles.\nGovernments that snubbed her request to suggest women (Austria, Ireland) found themselves without the 'big economic portfolio' they had sought, albeit gaining weighty jobs.\nIn 2019, von der Leyen was a surprise last-minute choice to lead the commission. She took office weeks before the Covid pandemic tipped Europe into unprecedented crisis. During lockdown, working with a small team in the commission's HQ, where she also lives \u2013 von der Leyen has a windowless converted washroom on the 13th floor \u2013 reinforced her penchant for taking decisions alone.\n'The question now for the next term is whether she can do normal,' Russack said. During von der Leyen's first term, she added, 'her team operated like a commando hub in a crisis and that worked so well. I wonder if she is able to wield her power in the same way when she doesn't have the excuse of an emergency.'\nSign up to Observed\nAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers\nafter newsletter promotion\nThe tasks in her in-tray are daunting: the brutal war in Ukraine and the spectre of Donald Trump in the White House. The EU is off-track with targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, while struggling to switch to a green economy in the face of heavily subsidised competition from China and the US.\nEarlier this month, the former president of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi said the EU must embrace deep reforms and spend \u20ac800bn (\u00a3670bn) a year to avert 'a slow and agonising decline'.\nFew expect EU leaders to agree on Draghi's ambitious agenda. In France, Macron is weakened after snap elections created a prolonged political stalemate. Germany's chancellor, Olaf Scholz, presides over a squabbling three-way coalition that is preoccupied with domestic politics after unprecedented victories for the far right in regional elections, with another defeat on the horizon on Sunday in Brandenburg.\nOne senior EU official cautioned against the idea that von der Leyen could step into a leadership vacuum. 'You are only as strong as the weakest link in the [European] council.'\nTo get legislation passed, von der Leyen needs not only EU member states, but also the European parliament, which has more far-right MEPs hostile to the EU than ever before. 'On legislation, she will have a lot of trouble,' said the senior official. 'You are no longer talking about 30 nutcases. You are now talking about 150 people who are not well intentioned.'\nThe big tent coalition of pro-EU parties that supported von der Leyen \u2013 from her own centre-right European People's party, the socialists, centrists and greens \u2013 will be tested. 'She will be much more vulnerable and prone to shifts in majority,' the official added.\nVon der Leyen's new commission is likely to take office around 1 December. These few months before the fray may be the peak of her powers.",

            "excerpt": "Rows over freebies and hints of unrest in No 10 have soured the mood of July's victory \u2013 and the poll numbers are plunging already",
            "summary": "An unlikely mood has descended on Labour MPs, officials and ministers as they head to Liverpool for the first party conference of an incoming Labour government since 1997. They secured a 174-seat landslide majority little more than two months ago, but the words being used to describe the atmosphere are not like they were 27 years ago. Some characterise it as surreal; others are more despairing that a series of 'unforced errors' have robbed Keir Starmer and his team of their political honeymoon.\n'What should have been a victory parade, and the height of the administration's powers, has already stalled,' said one MP. 'Hardly the most auspicious of starts for the next five years.'\nGripes over Starmer's odd predilection for free trips and trousers \u2013 a habit now jettisoned in the wake of stories about the freebies he, his wife and his top team have taken \u2013 have collided with complaints about the power and pay of his chief of staff, Sue Gray. The complaints are gnawing away at the prime minister's self-styled reputation as the person to clean up politics after years of Tory sleaze.\n'It's just further confirmation of how politically naive Starmer is,' said an MP. 'I have no doubt whatsoever that people like [New Labour architect Peter] Mandelson understand this and would probably have advised him not to go down the 'white knight in anti-sleaze armour' route.'\nYet there is a suspicion that these complaints have been driven by a bigger question that many MPs hope Starmer will begin to answer this week on Merseyside: having secured power, what is it actually for?\nFor many, the rows over freebies and the pay of his team are a symptom of the fact that he has not yet articulated a political narrative big enough to fill the vacuum.\nIt wasn't meant to be this way. Labour aides have been telling people that there will be record numbers at conference this year, with about 20,000 people, delegates and others, descending on Liverpool. For months, Starmer's officials had been planning how to strike the balance between celebration and getting on with the job of mending the country after 14 years of the Tories.\n'I don't think it's very happy in there,' said one insider, referring to Downing Street. '[Starmer] will be being pushed to lean into something more positive.' There are plans to make clear all the things that the government has already achieved in its short time in office \u2013 a manoeuvre also used by the party in 1997. But the sense that the prime minister needs to set a stronger sense of direction will be underlined by the worrying polling data now emerging.\nFollowing the complaints about freebies, the latest Opinium polling for the Observer shows cause for concern. Apart from a staggering fall in Starmer's personal approval ratings \u2013 down 45 points since July \u2013 Labour has declined on other polling measures. It has fallen 17 points when voters are asked if Labour has 'similar views to my own'; 20 points on whether it has 'the nation's best interests at heart', and 29 points on whether it is 'in touch with ordinary people'.\nFor some, this is the inevitable noise that comes with taking power at such a difficult moment for the public finances, with a tax-raising budget on the horizon. Others, however, see it as an early warning that Labour's support in the country started at a low base, despite the huge win, and that a stronger sense of direction is needed.\nHowever, it is a pressure Starmer understands. 'We had to make it clear what the inheritance was,' he says in his interview this week with the Observer. 'But I think \u2026 we do need to say why, and explain and set out and describe the better Britain that this ladders up to, if we get the original decisions right.'\nThe problem for Starmer this week is that if he fails to take a strong lead in showing his government's next steps, there are a few powerful figures in the union movement itching to give him a shove in a direction of their choosing. While the major Labour-affiliated unions have been incredibly obedient both during the election campaign and in the new government's early months \u2013 kept onside with the promise of a workers' rights overhaul and the end of anti-strike legislation \u2013 some, such as Unite, are now beginning to campaign in earnest against Labour's cut to winter fuel payments for most pensioners.\nIt is also working with others on a major conference confrontation on austerity. Its motion will condemn the winter fuel payment policy and call for a U-turn, and demand a wealth tax on top earners and changes to the fiscal rules to allow more borrowing and investment. Union sources said they were confident it would reach a vote in some form on Monday.\nEven allies of Starmer have become critical of what they fear is the 'Osborne playbook' being deployed by the Treasury team. Much more important to them is prioritising the missions Starmer set out before the election, aimed at restoring the NHS, boosting economic growth and pursuing clean power.\nThe left of the party is diminished, but some of its senior figures are setting out a narrative that chimes with a wider audience. John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor who was suspended from the party for voting against the government on an amendment calling on it to scrap the two-child limit on benefits, is among them. He believes that without more optimism and ambition from Labour, the beneficiary will be Nigel Farage and Reform UK.\n'It's one of the shortest honeymoons I've ever seen in politics,' he said. 'It was a toxic inheritance and people understand that. People want us to say how bad it is, of course, but then tell us how we're going to get through it \u2013 give us a bit of hope.\n'I was worried that if we didn't deliver by midterm, people would become disillusioned and it would be the far right that benefits from it, as we've seen in France and Germany. If we're threatened with an austerity budget, it just feeds Reform and Farage and all the rest. That's my worry.'\nAn MP still inside the parliamentary fold agrees. 'Reform thrives in chaos,' they said.",

            "excerpt": "The grey wolf expert on the incredible distances the predators travel, why dogs are a kind of dumbed down wolf \u2013 and her most hair\u2011raising close call",
            "summary": "The grey wolf (Canis lupus) has generated fear and hatred. Seen as a danger to livestock and people, the once widespread predator was nearly completely eradicated from western Europe and most of the contiguous US in the 19th and 20th centuries. Pro- and anti-wolf groups now duel over how the species should be managed as populations have rebounded in places over the past few decades. American wildlife biologist Diane Boyd, 69, has spent 40 years studying the recovery of wild wolf populations in remote north-western Montana and Glacier national park. When she started in the late 1970s on the University of Montana's Wolf Ecology Project (WEP) \u2013 which she later co-led \u2013 she was the only female biologist in the US trapping, radio-collaring and following their trails through the snow for research. Boyd's new memoir, A Woman Among Wolves, charts her life's work with the animals and looks at the challenges of wolf management across the world today.\nWhat is it about wolves that drew you in?I grew up in Minnesota, the only state in the lower 48, along with a tiny part of Michigan, where wolves hadn't been completely extirpated. They were denizens of the wilderness that nobody saw and that fascinated me. They are clever, beautiful and interesting animals. The parallels between wolf and human society are intriguing \u2013 like us, they are social, live in family groups and defend their homes. I have also always been a dog person: a dog is kind of a dumbed down version of a wolf.\nThe successful reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone national park and central Idaho in 1995 is celebrated as a great wildlife conservation achievement. But what is the untold story?That wolf recovery has been natural, too. Americans, along with the rest of the world, tend to think of wolves as all reintroduced and that reintroduction is the only way they become re-established: that is wrong. About 15 years prior to the Yellowstone and Idaho reintroductions, and just a few years after they had received federal endangered species status [granted in 1974], they walked down from Canada into north-western Montana and Glacier national park without any help or fanfare. And they began to filter out. The approximately 3,000 wild wolves in the western US today are, in part, because of that natural recolonisation.\nIs reintroduction worthwhile, or should we let wolves just return naturally?It is complicated. The advantage of reintroduction is it jump starts the process. The disadvantage is that wolves that are reintroduced can be resented by people: they're not seen as native or natural any more, which leads to potentially less tolerance and therefore longevity for them.\nAn amazing piece of the wolf recovery puzzle is how, enabled by legal protection, wolves have so successfully recolonised western Europe on their own (nowhere in Europe has there been any reintroductions), squeezing into human-dominated landscapes and surviving. Germany, Denmark and even the heavily farmed Netherlands have all become home.\nHow would a typical year studying the wolves unfold?Summer was trapping and radio-collaring. It is your classic, ugly, cold, steel foothold trap and it holds the animal against their will by their paw. The chance of success is low but you persist. I rebuilt the traps with modified parts to make them more humane and selective for wolves and we checked them often to minimise the time an animal was held. To fit the radio-collar, we would first tranquilise the wolf \u2013 I had a custom-made jab stick \u2013 and then wait nearby until it woke up.\nWinter was tracking our animals with radio telemetry gear \u2013 both from the air (we hired a plane and skilled pilot) and from the ground on skis or snowmobiles. Following a wolf's tracks in the snow is like reading a story. You can see where they stopped to sniff and pee, where they chased an animal and you learn their travel routes. We would also investigate wolf kills \u2013 skiing in after they left to determine what they had taken and its condition.\nIn spring, wolves den and we didn't bug them.\nYou've had some hair-raising encounters with all sorts of wild animals. Have you ever been bitten?I came close with an adolescent wolf we named Ice. We caught her on a cold rainy day and she was hypothermic. We drugged her and a colleague and I lay her on our laps in the front seat of our truck with the heater and our bodies trying to warm her up. As her temperature normalised, I turned the heater down and, though the rest of her was completely still, her ear swivelled in the direction of the click. I thought: 'Oh my God, this wolf is fully awake.' I indicated silently to another colleague outside the truck to open the door. What happened next was a whirlwind: she leapt to her feet on top us. I grabbed her by the scruff and directed her snout away as she bit at the steering wheel and the air. My colleague pushed her rump and I fell out of the truck hanging on to her. We landed; she jumped up and ran away. All in the day of a life of a wolf biologist!\nThe Wolf Ecology Project ran over 15 years until 1995. What did it reveal about wolves that was new?One of our most surprising findings, which hadn't been documented before \u2013 there weren't GPS collars then \u2013 was the distance wolves can travel: easily hundreds of miles within months. We would often get radio-collars returned from animals that had been shot huge distances away from their last signal or there would be a faraway sighting of a collared wolf. Our longest dispersal, Wolf 8551, was killed having travelled a straight-line distance of 540 miles north into Canada.\nWhat does the future hold for wolves in the US and beyond? The species has been delisted as endangered in parts of the west \u2013 Montana, Idaho and Wyoming \u2013 and state-managed hunting outside of national parks is now allowed there. Meanwhile, the EU is undertaking a review of wolves conservation status after growing complaints from farmers whose livestock has become prey.Those US states are required to maintain a population of 150 animals, but no more. And the new hunting laws they have adopted in the past few years are horribly archaic and torturous \u2013 allowing for wolves to be taken by virtually any method. In Europe, wolves have been well tolerated, but that has its limits. Wolves are resilient but ultimately their fate is up to us: they exist in the landscape at our whim. I hope we continue to protect them in enough areas that they will always be here.\nA Woman Among Wolves by Diane K Boyd is published by Greystone (\u00a318.99).

            "summary": "CNN \u2014\nNext week, an already very public debate over whether Ukraine should be allowed to use long-range Western-supplied missiles on Russian soil will come under an even brighter international spotlight.\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to meet not only US President Joe Biden, who has signaled he is open to discussing the issue, but also likely both US presidential candidates on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York.\nThose meetings come as experts say the public wrangling on this topic has raised the stakes of the decision, and potentially shifted the role these missiles - the Franco-British Storm Shadow/Scalps and US-made Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) - might play in this expanding war.\nIt was almost exactly a year ago, also during an in-person meeting with Zelensky in the United States, that Biden made the decision to supply the ATACMS to Ukraine.\nThe news did leak out, but official confirmation only came a month later, Zelensky burying it at the end of a nightly address on October 18. 'Our agreements with President Biden are being implemented,' he said. 'And they are being implemented very accurately \u2013 ATACMS have proven themselves.' By that point the missiles had, according to US officials, already been used in several strikes on Russian-occupied Luhansk and the southern coastal town of Berdiansk.\nA few months earlier, a similar story played out with the British Storm Shadows when then-Defence Secretary Ben Wallace only confirmed they had been supplied once they were already in use. In both cases, Ukraine promised not to use them on Russian territory.\nThis September, Zelensky is employing a strategy of more openly challenging his allies, and that, combined with Russia's open threats that any lifting of restrictions on their use would mean war with NATO, has turned the issue of firing these missiles into Russia into a political touchstone, an ultimate determinant of the extent of Western support.\nZelensky has refused to allow the topic to fall out of the headlines - publicly criticizing his allies' hesitation after a Russian strike on a military educational facility in Poltava killed more than 50 people earlier this month.\n'Every day of delay is, unfortunately, the death of people,' he said.\nLast weekend, after a Russian bomb attack on an apartment block in Kharkiv, he even made veiled accusations of cowardice, saying: 'This terror can be stopped. But to stop it, the fear of making strong, objectively necessary decisions must be overcome.'\n'Zelensky has taken a bit of a risk on this,' said Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank in London. 'He's almost playing political chicken. He's kind of daring people to support him.' If it happens though, the political dividend would be significant, says Savill, blunting Russian rhetoric and 'demonstrating firm international support' for Ukraine.\nAs for the battlefield dividend, that, experts say, is less clear cut.\nOpinion is divided on the extent to which the public debate around the missile permissions has blunted their potential utility - especially when it comes to targeting Russian fighter jets and missiles before they can be used against Ukraine's civilian infrastructure. US intelligence believes 90% of Russian aircraft that launch deadly glide bombs (at least 100 per day, according to Zelensky), are more than 300 kilometers (186 miles) from Ukrainian-controlled territory, so outside of ATACMS range. And that number may be increasing. Russia recently relocated planes from two bases near the border further east, according to one US official.\nSavill agrees 'lots of the juiciest targets' have likely been moved deeper into Russian territory, meaning the impact on the war may be 'limited.' But that doesn't mean the missiles have no utility. Storm Shadows, designed to penetrate deep into concrete, could be effective against military headquarters, or ammunition stores, many of which are still in range. ATACMS, some of which have cluster warheads, could be used to do significant damage to airfields. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a think-tank in Washington DC, has calculated that 15 Russian airfields are in range of ATACMs (though it's not clear how many aircraft are still housed on them).\nGeorge Barros, the author of that ISW research, agrees a less public debate may have been preferable, but if the very prospect of these permissions being granted has forced Russia to move aircraft further from the border, it's a good thing. It could reduce the number of bombing missions Russian planes can make (known in the military as the 'sortie rate') and buy Ukraine valuable detection and reaction time for incoming attacks.\nMore importantly, he believes that if Ukraine could strike Russian troops, weaponry and logistics within the 300-kilometer range of the top-end ATACMS, it would for the first time force Russia to calculate the risks of moving large amounts of troops and equipment into Ukraine.\n'You've only just now \u2026 started talking about a potential risk to Russia's rear area and depriving them of this insane luxury that the Russian command has leveraged. To really bring mass (equipment), to get 10 to one artillery ratios on Ukraine at the frontline,' he told CNN.\nBarros' research has pinpointed at least 200 potential targets that would be in range of ATACMs, ranging from military regiments to fuel depots, weapons storage depots, and even the headquarters of Russia's Southern Military district in Rostov (all of which would be much harder to move than aircraft).\nThe list is also conservative, Barros acknowledges, and has not accounted for new targets installed after the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. And some of the newest targets of all could, according to Savill, include Iranian FATH-360 ballistic missiles, which the US believes have already been supplied and have a range of just 75 kilometers (47 miles), far less than the Western missiles.\nExperts also agree the missiles could provide valuable support to Ukraine's drone and ground operations. Savill believes ATACMS could do serious damage to Russian air defense radars and systems, adding that 'if you punch a hole through, actually Ukrainian long-range drones have got better options to penetrate deeper into Russia.' Hitting Russian air defense systems in the border areas could also improve Ukraine's chances of retaking its own territory, said Barros.\n'You actually do open up some interesting areas where there's parts of occupying Ukraine that are no longer under Russia's air defense umbrella,' he said.\nThere's also the option in theory, Savill said, to extend the range of the missiles by launching from Ukrainian positions inside Kursk, though that could put Ukrainian bombers and missile launchers in the crosshairs of Russian air defenses.\nUltimately, Ukraine continues to argue that the ability to use Western-supplied long-range missiles inside Russia is part of the complex jigsaw puzzle of ending this war on Kyiv's terms \u2014 and a way to show Russia it cannot outlast Ukraine's allies.\nZelensky is heading to the US on the one hand buoyed by the Kursk offensive providing fresh evidence of both Ukrainian ingenuity and, he argues, the flimsiness of Russian 'red lines,' but on the other hand motivated by the prospect of a third winter with critical electricity shortages, and still inadequate supplies of equipment and manpower.\n'We need to have this long-range capability not only on the occupied territory of Ukraine, but also on Russian territory,' he told a large gathering of Ukraine's allies at the US' Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany earlier this month, 'so Russia is motivated to seek peace.'",

            "excerpt": "A new photography book explores the practice of memorialising beloved beasts, from a performing elephant in Las Vegas to service animals and the world's most loyal sheepdog.",
            "summary": "A new photography book explores the practice of memorialising beloved beasts, from a performing elephant in Las Vegas to service animals and the world's most loyal sheepdog.\nThe first time Paul Koudounaris visited Pet Haven Cemetery and Crematory in Gardena, California, the US author, photographer and expert in macabre art history was surprised to find his eyes wet with tears. \"After writing three books about death, and not being affected by anything, five hours with those little graves had finally broken me,\" he tells the BBC. \"The sentiment there had become overwhelming.\"\nFaithful Unto Death \u2013 Pet cemeteries, animal graves and eternal devotion, published by Thames & Hudson this month, is the culmination of Koudounaris's 11-year exploration of the cultural practice of memorialising animals, from hand-painted pet portraits lit by lanterns in a forested Helsinki graveyard to extravagant mausolea in New York and Boston made of granite and bronze.\nThe grave markers Koudounaris discovers commemorate a whole ark of animals. Beneath some lie great behemoths, such as Stoney the elephant, a regular performer at the Luxor Hotel, Las Vegas in the 1990s. Others pay homage to smaller companions: Jonny the snail, for example, befriended by a man whose garden he frequented in Echo Park, Los Angeles. \"It just goes to show that people can bond with any kind of animal,\" Koudounaris says.\n1. The first urban cemetery\nHumans have paid homage to companion animals for millennia. The ancient Egyptians built animal necropoli, mummifying their non-human friends so they might join them in the afterlife. But the pet cemetery as we now know it, says Koudounaris, began in England and was born of the Industrial Revolution. \"In the 19th Century, for the first time, more people are living in urban environments than rural environments, bringing this taste for animal ownership with them,\" he explains. Cremation was opposed by the Church, and a stigma \u2212 that persists today \u2212 forbade the burial of animals in human cemeteries. The first urban cemetery for animals, founded in 1881 in Hyde Park, London, answered the question of how to dispose of a swelling pet population in a location where private land was rare.\n2. Service animals\nThe continent took up the trend in 1899 when Paris, tired of its citizens throwing dead dogs into the Seine, opened the swirling Art Nouveau gates of the Cimeti\u00e8re des Chiens. As a new century dawned, the concept gradually went global. Today, the biggest adoptees are the Americans, with canine battle heroes acknowledged as far afield as Guam, Micronesia. Service animals are \"the most esteemed\", and their graves \"always the best tended\", says Koudounaris. One such grave, this time in Ilford Animal Cemetery in East London, commemorates Mary of Exeter, a pigeon who served in World War Two by carrying messages across the English Channel, a route that just one in 10 birds would survive. She was ambushed by Germany's specially trained birds of prey and riddled with shotgun pellets, but Mary \u2212 sewn up and fitted with a neck brace \u2212 performed mission after mission, surviving against the odds.\n3. The taboo of bereavement\nAt Wat Khlong Toei Nai, a Buddhist temple in Bangkok, owners can decorate their deceased pets with flowers and then take a boat ride to release their cremated remains into the river. \"One of the things that we're missing in Western culture is a ritual that provides closure,\" says Koudounaris, who, in his work as pet grief counsellor, found many people feeling guilty or embarrassed about the length and depth of their bereavement. \"I think that's why it's a lot easier if you're in a culture that believes in the reincarnation, the transference of the soul, to not have that kind of hierarchy, to not have that kind of taboo,\" he says. \"Because you might come back as a butterfly, a cat or a human\u2026 there's not that stratification.\"\n4. Shep the dog\nSometimes the story is not about an owner mourning a pet, but a pet mourning an owner. So it was with Shep, a Shepherd-Collie mix who, for six years, waited expectantly at the platform of Fort Benton railroad station in Montana, hoping his late owner, whose casket had been loaded onto an eastbound train in 1936, would one day return. The devoted dog became a local celebrity but refused the hospitality of well-meaning residents, preferring to keep up his vigil at the station. In 1942, deaf and infirm, he slipped into the path of a train. To assuage their grief and memorialise this most faithful of pets, the community buried Shep on a bluff overlooking the station, his name spelled out in bold yellow letters, and his painted silhouette watching the platform for eternity.\n5. Tawny the lion\nIt's perhaps Los Angeles Pet Memorial Park, founded in 1928, that most stretches what we think of as a pet. In a city where, writes Koudounaris, \"weird was the norm when it came to animal burials\", many of the deceased were performers in Hollywood's film industry or faithful friends of stars. Mae West's monkey, Boogie, is there, as is Topper, Hopalong Cassidy's trusty steed. Among them is Tawny (1918-40), the roaring lion at the start of an MGM film, and a regular in the Tarzan movies. Owner Mary McMillan doted on Tawny, who she rescued from a circus when he was a cub. Neighbours were less enthusiastic, woken in the night by his almighty roar. When Cinderella, a stray tomcat, joined the household, the two felines must have sensed their shared genealogy. Though vastly different in size, they became inseparable. Fitting, then, that they now share one grave.\n6. Blinky the hen\nIn 1978, Los Angeles Pet Memorial Park's tolerance for weirdness was really tested when conceptual artist Jeffrey Vallance turned up requesting a burial for Blinky, a headless Foster Farms fryer chicken he had purchased from the frozen section of his local supermarket. As the cemetery's staff was expecting a pet hen with feathers intact, this bald lump of meat must have raised more than a few eyebrows. Whether it was a piece of performance art or a prank at the cemetery's expense, the act raised important questions about cultural norms that cherish some animals while see others only as food.\n7. Emily the rat and friends\nAn uptick in animal rights awareness in the early 1990s saw activism seep into pet cemeteries, replacing the avant-garde art created by Vallance with hard-hitting, unambiguous inscriptions. At the six-acre (24,281 sq m) Aspin Hill Memorial Park, a pet cemetery in Maryland, US, a memorial, topped with a chubby rodent nursing its tail, is dedicated to \"the millions of rats used in medical experimentation and product testing\". Elsewhere in the cemetery, a grave full of sable coats labelled \"products of human ignorance and vanity\" needles again at our conscience.\n8. Makeshift cemeteries\nUnsignposted, and dotting remote landscapes such as the deserts of South America and the American West, where there is \"ample public land\" and \"a paucity of prying eyes\", writes Koudounaris, the off-the-grid, handmade animal graveyards are perhaps the most touching of all. Most graves are simply marked by a painted rock or a makeshift wooden cross, although some have mailboxes, where owners have left letters for the dead. With no central administration or maintenance, \"they, themselves, have a lifespan,\" says Koudounaris. \"You'll see them grow and you'll see them wither.\" Whether it's a painted board or a life-size marble sculpture, \"what started in England eventually becomes something that exists in many forms worldwide,\" says Koudounaris. \"But they are all dedicated to the same thing: this idea that an animal that has been loved in life deserves a dignified end.\"\nFaithful Unto Death \u2013 Pet cemeteries, animal graves and eternal devotion, published by Thames & Hudson is available in the US and in the UK now.\n--\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

            "summary": "New York CNN \u2014\nEdwin Moses always loved the sport of track and field. But reaching the Olympics always seemed like a tall order.\nAt a young age, Moses was a lot smaller than the other runners. In high school, he was 5-feet-7 tall and weighed 117 pounds and frequently found himself at the back of the pack during races. But as he grew physically, he got faster and progessively found himself leading races, rather than trailing.\nThen at Morehouse College, Moses \u2013 a physics and engineer major \u2013 used maths to calculate that he needed to take exactly 13 steps between hurdles to maximize efficiency in the 400-meter hurdles.\n'It just really made sense when you're out on the track and you're dealing with running 400m worth of hurdles, 10 hurdles, then it behooves you to kind of find the shortest way or the most efficient way,' Moses told CNN.\nUsing that methodology, Moses would go onto become a two-time Olympic gold medalist and a two-time world champion.\nFor nine years, nine months and nine days Moses was unbeaten in races, winning 122 in a row. No other athlete has come close to breaking that record.\nWhile the sports world was consumed with his unprecedented winning streak, Moses was not. 'I just went about my business, did my program and let the winning take care of itself. I always knew that I was 100% ready no matter what.'\nAt the height of his popularity, Moses \u2013 who was once considered shy and to have a quiet personality \u2013 became a 'big mouth,' he says, as he fought against racism, performance enhancing drugs and unfair compensation in his sport.\nHis activism put his amateur eligibility at risk and made him the subject of high-profile scandals. But he believes speaking out as he did back in the 1970s and 1980s has benefited Olympic athletes today.\n'The reason that they're all making money today is because the fact that I sacrificed my potential eligibility for the Olympic Games and could have been banned and was investigated for taking money when it wasn't lawful,' Moses, 69, said. 'That's why track and field and swimming, gymnastics and all of them can do anything today.'\nFifty years after he burst onto the international stage, Moses is still using sports as a vehicle for change.\nFor 20 years, he was the inaugural chairman of the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation, an organization that helps children overcome struggles in their lives. Today, while in a different role with Laureus, he remains committed to using sports to make a difference in the lives of children all over the world.\nMoses' journey on and off the field is chronicled in the new documentary, 'Moses \u2013 13 Steps,' produced by Oscar-winner Morgan Freeman. It is a story the athlete has wanted to tell for nearly 20 years.\nMoses and I spoke at length about his journey.\nWhy did you want to participate in this documentary?\nIn 2005, I was at the Laureus World Sports Awards. And Morgan was our special host and he introduced me and he said: 'Edwin Moses, nine years, nine months, nine days, 122 races, Morehouse man, undefeated world champion, Olympic champion.' And he said: 'Why is there no film on Edwin Moses?'\nAnd so, it became kind of something that I really wanted to do. And my friends quite frankly were demanding it.\nAnd then later in 2020, right before the COVID epidemic started, I was approached by a film team out of Germany, Broadview TV. And we started discussing the possibility of doing a film. They're an international boutique documentary firm and they understood the story because they're Germans. A lot of my history of running track and the IOC and all those activities happened in Europe.\nSo that's how the concept got started.\nWhen the winning streak of 122 straight races ended in Madrid in 1987, how did that moment feel?\nI was food poisoned that night, that whole week. So I really didn't want to run. But I did and I ran faster than I had ever run that early in the season because I generally didn't do a lot of early season meets and I waited for the European season, like June through October.\nI could have lost any of the 122 races. I had run sick, had run injured and had I not hit that last hurdle, I would have won that race, 100%.\nThat one false step did me in that day. But I was not disappointed with the results. I was quite happy, the world championships were coming up about two months later, so I knew I was in tip-top condition. So it didn't really matter to me. If you get your heart broken because you lose in track and field, you're in the wrong sport.\nShould politics be a part of sports?\nIt is a part of sports. I mean, sports has its own specific issues in politics. We see them all the time today. You have fights and spats over drug tests. You have fights and spats over eligibility where some athletes live in one country and want to switch to another country, over gender, over nationalism.\nSo it's always there. And the United States, we're the only Olympic committee in the world that doesn't have a sports minister. So all these other countries, their sports is directly linked to their politics except ours. So it's absolutely involved.\nIt has a lot to do with all the decisions that are made that we never hear about generally in public, the average person doesn't know. But it's all government driven behind the scenes, just not on the track. On the track and in the field, people think that it should be non-political and it is because of the nature of sports.\nBut behind the scenes politics is weighing heavily on everything that happens in the world of sports.\nFrom where the Olympics are held, to where the football World Cup is held and everything in between, it's all dictated by politics.\nWhen Olympians John Carlos and Tommie Smith put their fists up in the air while on the podium at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico, as a Black boy growing up in Dayton, Ohio, what did that moment mean to you?\nYou have to understand the perspective of the times. In the sixties, we had multiple assassinations. Robert Kennedy. John Kennedy. Medgar Evers. Malcolm X., Dr. Martin Luther King. We had the Vietnam War going on during the same time in the late sixties, early seventies.\nWe had the civil rights laws that were being drafted in '64 and '65, the March on Washington. So the United States was a very volatile place and there was a tremendous amount going on and I was a teeny bopper during that time.\nAt our age, 12, 13, 14, 15, we were beginning to understand what the world was about because you could see it on the news and what kind of constraints that we were under as Black kids still in segregated high schools in Dayton, Ohio.\nWhen we saw Tommy and John, it was just great because we had an example right in our faces as to the power of African American men and their voice on the issues. Although theirs was a worldwide issue, everyone had their fists in the air. So it was great.\nWhat does Morehouse mean to you?\nMorehouse changed my life. I went there at a fantastic time to go there. When I was a student, no one was talking about the HBCUs (historically Black colleges and universities) the way that they talk about them now.\nI went at 17 years old as a little boy and came out the other end as a man. They taught us about leadership and academics and responsibility and gave us the confidence that we can go out into the world and accomplish anything in any area.\nWe didn't have to worry about anyone concerned about why we were out of school, whether we were on academic welfare at the school. And we didn't have to worry about anyone stabbing us in the back and everyone's cheering for each other. So for me, it was the only atmosphere in which I could have thrived.\nIf I'd have gone to name the school and name the track program with all the best coaches and everything, there would have never been no Edwin Moses. It was that unique area and opportunity despite the fact that we had no track and had no field. That's the kind of power that a Morehouse education can provide for you and give you the confidence that you can do anything even if it's impossible.",

            "summary": "Double exposure with hands holding money in the jar and glasses, calculator and pen on financial ... [+] papers background. save money for investment concept\nCareful research done by PhD economists conclude we face a huge retirement shortfall. We are about eight to nine years away from Social Security's inability to pay full benefits; all boomers are past age 60, and the typical Gen Y and Millennial is predicted to do a little worse or much worse than the cohorts of their big brothers, sisters, and parents. The erosion in retirement security is worse for the bottom 60% or so of the earnings distribution. Yes it's a crisis.\nEarly boomers at the top of the income distribution have benefited from run-ups in the stock market, owning houses, and having employers who helped them save in retirement accounts and funded defined benefit plans. The top 20% of earners get 44% of all the employer contributions according to Vanguard who examined 401(k) - type employer plans. The nation's private, commercial, voluntary employer \u2013 retirement plans exacerbate pay inequity and retirement income inequality.\nEven Andrew Biggs, economist at the conservative think tank, American Enterprise Institute (which has been associated with partially privatizing and reducing Social Security benefits) agrees federal and state tax law steer tax breaks to the top earners.\nAnd can we really say we don't have a retirement crisis for regular working households when new 2022 data from the Federal Reserve bank the Survey of Consumer Finance, shows the middle 70% of households by income aged 50-65 have a median retirement account savings of $86,000 and a median debt of $89,700? If you withdraw from your $86,000, say between age 65 and 70, traveling, buying a car\u2014 you'll look comfortable. But all that money could be gone by your mid-seventies and then it's Social Security all the way to the end.\nAbout 40% of middle-class older workers are projected to be downwardly mobile into poverty or near poverty when they reach age 62 and beyond. Disagreements rest on the definition of 'poverty.' How can a serious researcher say $13,000 a year is a standard to shoot for; I reject the U.S. definition of poverty and so do most experts and practitioners.\nThe U.S. poverty measures depart from internationally acceptable standards and consistently lowballs how much hardship we have. No serious researcher uses the U.S. standard as a measure of financial deprivation. Most antipoverty programs define poverty as 150% or 200% of the official rate. According to the U.S. official number, you are a poor elder if your annual income is below about $13,000. Internationally, an American elder is counted as poor when their incomes fall below 50% of median, which is about $21,000. Measured this way, my coauthors including economist Siavash Radpour, found downward mobility worsening after the pandemic.\nThe U.S. has the highest rate of elder poverty of any of our peer advanced-Western countries. By international standards, one out of four elder Americans over 65 live in a chronic state of want, in comparison the elder poverty rate is a low 5% in the Netherlands and about 10% in Germany, which is not atypical. This is a crisis and a shame.\nTony Webb, Michael Papadopoulos, and I found in the Illusory Benefits of Working Longer that without working, 79% of people in 2028 age 62-70 would not be able to afford their pre-retirement living standards or stay about de-facto poverty levels. And we included everything we could estimate \u2014 defined benefit plan benefits, Social Security, home equity!\nI can see how this grim assessment puzzles people if you just encountered a careful paper by Peter J. Brady of the Investment Company Institute and Stephan Bass at Internal Revenue Service. But they didn't look forward boomers aging or Gen Y and younger. They only studied the relatively-advantaged 1945 birth cohort at age 72 and included earnings from paid work. They conclude retirement looks better than many think. But they make no claims about the future. They can't. And people working aren't retired. This cohort also got the best part of traditional defined benefit pension plans, they were able to collect peak Social Security benefits before the raising the retirement age cut benefits for middle boomers and younger, and who got the most out of a steady increase in housing asset values.\nAnd, Harvard economist Karen Dyson et. al. agree the younger cohorts will likely do worse than current retirees.\nDeniers also cherry \u2013 pick surveys show most retirees feel comfortable. But comfort levels depends on the survey. We surveyed the surveys. The results depend on who you ask. Eight robust and frequently-cited surveys on retirement confidence conducted by government bodies, research groups, and industry advocates show a wide range of retirement anxiety, from a high of 71% to a low of 32%. Levels of retirement anxieties differ by age, working status, and retirement status. The majority of near retirees in the middle and lower incomes are the most nervous about their retirement futures. And they should be.\nBottom line. The startling finding that 79% of age 62 \u2013 70 don't have enough retirement income, without working surprised me. But projections based on real wealth data from the University of Michigan convinces me it's true. New data could change my mind.\nBiggs is right. This assertion needs modifying: 'Nearly half of older Americans have no retirement savings and must rely solely on Social Security in old age.' I should have written:\nI agree 100 percent dependence on Social Security is rare. And the Census Bureau analyzed only 12.2 percent of seniors get at least 90 percent of their income from Social Security. I agree many people have Social Security and other forms of income at young old ages. But as you age those other sources of income fade away. Work disappears, cash piles are spent, expenses rise, you live longer and sicker than you think, and levels eroded away by inflation.\nAs MIT economist James Poterba and colleagues note \u2014 in research that needs updating \u2014 a substantial fraction of persons die with virtually no financial assets and rely almost entirely on Social Security benefits for support. True, many of these households may be deemed to have been prepared for retirement because their income in old age was not substantially lower than their low income in their late 50s or early 60s. But saying a high replacement rate of a very low income (which is what incomes are right before retirement typically) is surely a poor way to judge sufficiency.\nRetirement crisis deniers promote their rosy picture about retirement by taking snapshots when people are relatively young retirees and working at older ages in professional jobs. The average income of 70-year-olds looks a lot different than the median income of 75- or 80-year-olds.\nAnd we are going backwards. People in retirement used to be closer together in terms of income and wealth. People in retirement now and in the future are farther apart, retirement income inequality is growing along with longevity inequality. See the new book Longer Lives Are for the Rich .\nAdditionally, economists John Sabelhaus and Alice Henriques Volz find that the people in the top wealth levels are doing a bit better (based on the wealth they have they expect to use in old age) than people born 10 and 20 year years earlier. A rosy picture there. But a full 50% of people at the bottom of the wealth distribution are doing worse than their older sisters and brothers' cohort and parents' cohort who were at the same place in terms of their wealth at their age. This isn't about how much they will get; it is a finding that shows our retirement system has aged so that some people are going backwards, and inequality is increasing.\nRetirement financial security for Baby Boomers and Generation Xers is worse than for earlier retirees. I agree with Alicia Munnell, I don't care what you call the problem \u2013 a crisis or very bad problem \u2014 'roughly half of households are not in good financial shape in retirement.'\nThe retirement crisis deniers don't show up advocating more revenue into Social Security. The retirement crisis deniers say that 12.9% or 10% poverty measured the American way shows we don't have to make large reforms. But the facts are restoring and expanding Social Security would prevent major setbacks. In 'How-Gloomy is the Retirement Outlook- respected Urban Institute researchers Karen Smith and Richard Johnson show that median age-70 income will be higher for Millennials than previous generations, but this cohort faces a higher risk of seeing falling living standards in retirement.\nHigher income in retirement does not mean being better off if people face more expenses and are living longer. As Forbes contributor Howard Gleckman writes, the biggest threat to over half of earners retirement security \u2014 those in the lower and middle class \u2014 is to not do anything about fully funding and expanding Social Security.\nIn the end, one of the best portraits of the retirement crisis comes from a compilation of academic work and government statistics. Check out the Chartbook, for snapshots older workers' status and retirement wealth. Make up your own mind about whether we have a problem so big we need to fix the commercial and voluntary system and Social Security. I guess you can still think everything is fine and there is nothing to be done, but I would want to see the numbers. for me the facts show otherwise.",

            "excerpt": "After days of freebie rows, leaks and squabbles, the prime minister expresses frustration and says that at Labour's conference this week he will explain what a better Britain looks like",
            "summary": "Before the election, Keir Starmer said he was determined to ensure that he didn't let being prime minister deny him time with his family and made a kind of promise to his wife and two children that Friday nights would be sacrosanct. When we meet him at No 10, we wonder how that is working out. 'In some respects, that's a little bit easier because it's a 30 seconds commute,' he says, pointing upwards to the living quarters. 'The kids can pop in when they get back from school, even if it's only for a few minutes before they go up to the flat.'\nOn the other hand, the schedule since Labour took office has been 'relentless'. Getting the government going on its domestic agenda has been accompanied by a packed calendar of foreign travel, including a Washington summit, a Nato summit, visits to Italy and Ireland, and two trips to 'reset the relationship with key partners' to France and Germany. 'Making time is important, because you're a better decision-maker if you have a bit of time with your family.' He speaks with regret about cancelling his summer holiday after the August outbreak of far-right violence on the streets. 'It would have been good to have got away over the summer for a break, if I'm honest, because we've been running at this for a long time. Whilst the campaign itself was six and a bit weeks, the truth is we've been in campaign mode since at least the turn of the year. I haven't had a day off since Rishi stood out there in the rain without his umbrella. I also know that this is not a good thing. Everybody, including politicians, needs to get away from time to time to have holidays.'\nThere may be some public sympathy that he has not had a day off. Much less so about the revelations that he's been happy to take a lot of freebies. The value of the gifts he accepted in the last parliament comes in north of \u00a3100,000, ahead of any other MP. Given the stink it is causing, does he now regret being so free with the freebies? 'It is very easy to say politicians shouldn't have any gifts,' he responds. 'But it is quite tricky in practice.'\nHe focuses his justification on accepting hospitality at football matches, presumably because he thinks he can muster a more solid defence for this than he can for some of the other gift-taking that is raising eyebrows. He's had a season ticket to watch Arsenal 'for a very long time. I go with my boy, I go with our friends and we go in the stands. That is what we do, week in and week out, during the season.'\nIf he'd carried on using the stands, 'they'd have to put in a hell of a security detail to get me in there which would cost quite a lot of money. As a result, I was offered a gift to move elsewhere in the stadium to watch the game.' He'd rather be in the stands but contends that it would be 'a bit self-indulgent' to insist on it 'if that costs the taxpayer a fortune in extra security'.\nSome voters may find that a reasonable argument. But what about the rest of it: the Taylor Swift and Coldplay tickets along with the clothing and 'luxury eyewear' valued at more than \u00a32,000 bought for him by a wealthy Labour donor who was temporarily given a pass to No 10 after the election and who also provided high-end clothes for the prime minister's wife, Victoria.\nThe typical voter has to pay for clothes and treats out of their own pocket and surely will be wondering why a prime minister who says he is the champion of working people isn't doing the same. Doesn't this make people think it's no different to the Tories?\nHe swerves this challenge. 'If you look at what we promised to voters, we promised that we would bring about change. Make sure the economy works so \u2026 they were better off. Make sure the health service is working properly. Bring down their energy bills.' At the end of his list, he says: 'That's what I'll be judged on. I know I'll be judged at the end of the five years, and rightly so.'\nBut might he also not be judged on freebies which aren't a happy fit with his manifesto commitment to introduce a much more ethical regime to government. 'I've always said the rules have to be complied with. What I went after [Boris] Johnson on was not complying with the rules.'\nSubsequent to our conversation, and following revelations that Angela Rayner, Rachel Reeves and other members of Labour's top team have taken donations to buy outfits, the government has surrendered to pressure to stop accepting clothes as gifts. But during our interview, Starmer refuses to agree that it would be best not to take any freebies at all.\n'Well look,' he says defiantly. 'I mean, am I going to now say I won't go to another Arsenal game? Then, no.' What about the designer specs? 'I don't need any new specs for a long time.'\nThe other toxic stream of stories in the run-up to the Labour conference has been about infighting at No 10. The most recent outbreak of backbiting has centred on the salary paid to his chief of staff, Sue Gray. At \u00a3170,000 a year, her remuneration comes in higher than his own. Does this indicate that she is the most powerful person in Downing Street?\n'I'm not going to talk about individual salaries for any member of staff,' he responds before saying something that shouldn't really need saying. 'I'm the person who runs the government. I'm the person that takes the decisions and I'm the person that takes responsibility for those decisions.'\nDetails of who is earning what at No 10 and how X is jostling for influence with Y do not come from nowhere. They're coming from people on the inside passing information to journalists. Why is his ship such a leaky one? 'There shouldn't be any leaking,' he says, not denying that leakers are responsible. 'That just damages everybody.'\nHe doesn't quarrel with the suggestion that he needs to get a grip before it spirals completely out of control. 'It's my job to do something about that and I accept that responsibility.'\nHe argues that it is highly unfair to suggest that squabbles about salaries is the only story to be told about his government. 'In the other column, I would point out: what is No 10 focused on every day? What's the cabinet focused on every day?'\nWith that, he launches into a 'rattle through what we've done', which includes setting up the national wealth fund and GB Energy, putting a new planning framework in place to encourage swifter construction of essential national infrastructure and more homebuilding, as well as starting recruitment of additional police officers and teachers.\nSign up to Observed\nAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers\nafter newsletter promotion\n'If you look at the list of what we have already done in 11 weeks, then I would argue strongly that we've done far more than the last government did probably in the last 11 years.'\nHe continues: 'Leaking, I know how damaging it is. In the end, it only damages the government, so I'm not going to pretend otherwise. But I would also point out there's a lot of work that's gone on, being delivered through No 10 and the cabinet.'\nSince he arrived there, he's delivered a lot of words about the direness of the inheritance from the Tories and accompanied this with the warning that things are going to get worse before they get better. Can the Labour conference, which opens on Sunday in Liverpool, expect a further deluge of miserabilism or will he have some more optimistic things to say to his party and to the public? 'I want to answer the 'why' question as well as the 'what' question. In the first 11 weeks, we have answered the 'what' question \u2013 what did we inherit? This \u00a322bn black hole is a real problem \u2026 We're going to have to deal with it upfront.'\nIf Labour is ultimately to deliver improved economic growth and everything else it has promised, it has 'to do the tough things first' so 'in years to come, people will look back and say: 'That Labour government in 2024 really got to grips with it.''\nHe embarks on one of his favoured metaphors, which is to compare his task to restoring a rotting building. 'When you're redecorating a house, you can be tempted to paint over the damp and the cracks, and people do. Landlords often do. But the damp comes back. The cracks are still there.' Better, he argues, to 'strip it down' to do the job properly.\nThe criticism, which is to be widely heard among his colleagues, is that he has not painted an appealing picture of what it will be like living in the house once it has been refurbished. 'We had to make it clear what the inheritance was. But, to accept your challenge, we do need to say why and explain and set out and describe the better Britain that this ladders up to.' He adds: 'That is the central purpose of my conference speech, which is to answer that very question.'\nThere will be ructions at the conference from trades unions and party activists who oppose ending the universality of the winter fuel payment by restricting it to pensioners on pension credit. He continues to defend the government's most contentious act so far. 'We've got \u00a322bn to find and there are no easy decisions when you've got \u00a322bn to find\u2026 We couldn't pretend it's not there\u2026 That means really difficult decisions.'\nHe also suggests that there will be more of them to come. 'It's going to be tough' he says of Reeves's budget at the end of October.\nHe has a potentially more reassuring message for those who fear that a Labour version of austerity is coming down the track which will entail deep cuts to public spending. 'I'm acutely aware that our public services are on their knees. I ran a public service. I know what cuts feel like. And I know that a lot of them are cut to the bone.'\nHe has been heard to say in the past that the time he spent as an opposition MP were 'the most futile' of his life. For all the battalions of troubles already assailing him, he's clearly relishing holding the levers of power. Comparing government with opposition, he remarks: 'It's much tougher, but much better, if that makes sense. It's tougher than being in opposition because you've got to make real decisions. But it's better because you get to make real decisions.' Yes, that does make sense.",

            "excerpt": "Beginning with Amex, Buffett sought to uncover undervalued but fundamentally good businesses with capable managers, then let them do their jobs.",
            "summary": "This story brings together a tipster, a villain, a visionary, and Warrren Buffett, arguably the greatest investor of all time. And it's mixed with salad oil.\nTino DeAngelis had an early business start in the meat industry. He was allegedly involved in black market sales during World War II. He paid $100,000 in damages for exporting substandard cooking fat to Yugoslavia. After acquiring control of a public meatpacker, he was required to pay new damages of $100,000 because of inferior products. Then another one of his companies was accused of exporting inferior lard to Germany, resulting in 'the usual' $100,000 in damages. DeAngelis later created Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Refining Corporation (Allied). Allegations of fraud and underworld connections followed him.\nAmerican Express Company (Amex) was dominant in travel and financial services. In 1960, Howard Clark became chief executive. His priority was focusing on the viability of the money-losing American Express credit card. He then focused on four marginally-profitable Amex subsidiaries. One was the separately incorporated American Express Field Warehousing Company (AEFW). It had made money in only 10 of the past 19 years and had a cumulative loss. In the late 1950s, AEFW had 500 client accounts, but all the profits were from two companies, with the same owner: DeAngelis. One company was Allied.\nIn 1956, Warren Buffett, age 25, started his first investment partnership. In 1962, He dissolved all eleven partnerships and brought them into Buffett Partnership Ltd. (BPL). Net assets were $7.2 million. Buffett was already a millionaire. BPL had strong performance. Buffett inherited his value-investing style from Benjamin Graham. Buffett viewed stock investing akin to owning a business, but only at a reasonable price. Buffett's 1964 investment in Amex would begin a different investing approach.\nPrior to Buffett's Amex acquisition, he pushed for board representation or control, like with his Dempster Mill Manufacturing Company investment. Buffett pushed management to increase profits but was unsuccessful. So, he installed a new manager who turned things around, but at a reputational cost to Buffett. The new management team laid off one hundred workers from the only town factory. Buffett was vilified in the local newspaper. Starting with Amex, Buffett's approach was to first uncover undervalued firms that were fundamentally good businesses with capable managers, then let them do their jobs.\nIn June 1960, Donald Miller, chief executive of AEFW, received a phone call from a tipster, 'the Voice.' He claimed to work the night shift at Allied in Bayonne, New Jersey. He warned Miller, 'The biggest hoax ever pulled is being pulled on American Express because there is in fact water in the tanks, and we are counting it as oil. Whenever we went to take inventory at the tank, we would be dropping the weight into this metal chamber, which was filled with soybean oil, but the balance of the tank had water in it.'\nMiller ordered a surprise inspection at Allied. Inspectors found all the tank openings were welded shut except for the measuring hatch. They then found water in the five tanks they were able to check. However, when they returned after the weekend, there was nothing suspicious in the other tanks. A report later attributed water to 'broken steam pipes.' Business between Allied and AEFW continued as usual.\nUnbeknownst to investigators, DeAngelis had created an elaborate network of pipes with false compartments and special sampling tubes that held actual oil. Three years later, when the fraud was finally detected, when the tap on one tank was finally opened, instead of $4 million of soybean oil, seawater poured out for 12 days.\nIn 1961, Allied started buying heavily in the oil futures market. By 1963, DeAngelis was pushing up the prices of oil futures in anticipation of heavy demand by foreign countries. Rumors swirled that Russia's crops had failed, and Russia would soon be buying U.S. vegetable oil. Actually, there were bumper foreign crops, so high futures prices weren't sustainable.\nWith each subsequent oil price decline, Allied needed to provide more money in margin accounts. By November 1963, the exchanges and government commodities agencies finally realized that Allied was driving up futures prices. When a commodities exchange investigator demanded to see Allied's records, the gig was up. Allied filed for bankruptcy. Futures prices plummeted. AEFW's warehouse receipts had totaled twice as much vegetable oil as all the oil in the U.S.\nAmex was a joint stock company, the last large U.S. public company with unlimited liability. By 1963, Amex was considering incorporating, becoming a limited liability company like almost all other public companies.\nSoon after Allied went bankrupt, claims against AEFW were more than $150 million, close to the year-end value of Amex's stock of $162 million. Since AEFW was a separately incorporated subsidiary, Amex probably wasn't responsible for its liabilities. But there were legal rules that might have overridden the separation. This created uncertainty about Amex's potential liability.\nRegardless, Clark pondered whether Amex should compensate losses at AEFW. He considered important stakeholders with different perspectives. If Amex denied liability for AEFW, banks would suffer losses. Given the huge role banks played in Amex's travelers cheques business, that might kill all the business banks brought to Amex.\nConversely, satisfying bankers might upset shareholders. Clark also had to consider how the swindle would affect customers. Would they stop using Amex products? With permission of the board, on November 27, 1963, Clark publicly announced: 'If our subsidiary should be liable for amounts in excess of its insurance coverage and other assets, American Express Company feels morally bound to do everything it can, consistent with its overall responsibilities, to see that such excess liabilities are satisfied.'\nThe swindle started featuring in the press on November 20, 1963, with few details. Two days later, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. $11 billion in shareholder value was destroyed in the half hour before an emergency closure of the NYSE. Kennedy's death relegated the Great Salad Oil Swindle to the back pages. Intrigued by the possibility of buying the stock cheaply, Buffett tracked Amex's stock price. Even after markets reopened, the stock never recovered and continued to drop. Based on the market's reaction, the survival of Amex was in doubt. Between November 20 to December 2, its price dropped from $61.81 to $40.00 and would bottom on June 2, 1964, at $35.31, a drop of 43 percent in less than eight months since the scandal broke.\nBuffett wondered what impact the scandal would have on Amex's reputation. With travelers cheques and credit cards, trust mattered. Buffett needed facts. So he and an acquaintance visited restaurants and other places that accepted Amex cards and cheques. They talked to bank tellers, bank officers, credit-card users, hotels employees, and restaurants workers to get a feel for whether usage had fallen off. Based on that research, Buffett concluded that while Wall Street had punished Amex by battering the stock price, Amex's reputation hadn't been tarnished on Main Street.\nBy early 1964, BPL was flush with cash from both profits and new money, with capital of $17.5 million. It takes both strong conviction and nerves of steel for to risk huge amounts of capital on one stock. But that's what Buffett did. By June 1964, he had invested $3 million in Amex, BPL's largest single holding, at 17 percent.\nBefore an eventual resolution with creditors, some shareholders took action against the firm, arguing Amex had no legal obligation to settle liabilities of AEFW. They felt any settlement would hurt Amex's shareholder value. They were particularly concerned that holders of many forged warehouse receipts that DeAngelis invented would be compensated.\nBuffett felt management was doing the right thing and was concerned that trying to derail any settlement would damage the brand. Buffett sent a letter to Clark, praising management, and imploring them to settle for the sake of reputation. Buffett likened the situation to a typhoon that would soon pass. He even offered to testify, at his own expense, supporting management's actions. This was another pivotal moment for Buffett, taking a long-term perspective, willing to sacrifice short-term profitability. Buffett's assessment of Amex's future was accurate. Almost six decades later, Buffett still owned Amex stock.\nThe period when Buffett was buying Amex's stock was mid-April to June 1964. Its average price was $41.22. Two-and-a-half years later, Amex's stock was $92.50, a gain of 124 percent. The Dow lost 6 percent over that period. Given the amount of capital risked, Buffett's ability to buy near the bottom, and the huge gains in such a brief period, arguably this was one of the best investments ever, certainly for Buffett and his partnership.\nBy 1967, Amex negotiated a $60 million settlement with creditors. After-tax, that was $31.6 million. Profits between the time the scandal broke and the settlement exceeded that amount. Amex was able to put the scandal behind it by late 1964.\nAmex executives later realized the swindle was the greatest public-relations event in its history. Press coverage was favorable, and the public saw that Amex stood behind its obligations. In 1964 travelers cheques sales increased by 12 percent. Later Clark was asked if a salad oil swindle every few years might be a clever idea. He replied: 'I don't think I have enough good years of my life to give away for another swindle.'\nThe scandal showed why character and reputation matter. DeAngelis had a long record of unscrupulous behavior and never really changed. Paying fines was just a cost of doing business. Yet it didn't deter other companies from dealing with him, until his empire came crashing down.\nWhy did banks and commodity exporters increasingly lend to DeAngelis's businesses? Before his downfall, rumors had swirled for years that a swindle was happening at Allied. Partly, it was tunnel vision. One lender commented, 'We didn't deal with this Tino character. We dealt with American Express.' There's no substitute for your own analysis. Buffett did a lot of legwork before investing in Amex. He didn't simply rely on a hunch.\nClark made a bold decision by pronouncing that Amex was 'morally bound' to cover AEFW's liability. He recognized the importance of a brand's reputation. He also didn't let a good crisis go to waste. Both Clark and Buffett recognized that long-term value trumped short-term profit.\nWhat was the root cause of the scandal? Incentives and motives matter. To survive, AEFW needed to show consistent profits. This may have caused Donald Miller to overlook DeAngelis's character flaws, since his dealings with Allied were profitable. As author Norman Miller concluded, 'Tino succeeded because bankers, brokers and business[people], despite the glaring indications that they were dealing with a crook, could not resist the bait of big profits\u2026The reason they were convinced that Tino's deals were good can be stated in one word\u2014greed.'\nThose bankers, brokers, and businesspeople were all greedy until they feared they would lose it all. Buffett turned that premise on its head when he famously proclaimed his investing goal: 'We simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.' Stocks may become overvalued when everyone wants to invest in them, and undervalued when no one wants them.\nAdapted with permission from the publisher, Wiley, from Trailblazers, Heroes, and Crooks: Stories to Make You a Smarter Investor by Stephen R.

            "summary": "As my boat cruises toward the private island city of Indian Creek Village \u2014 better known as the Billionaire Bunker \u2014 I'm hoping my trip doesn't end in an arrest.\nIt's a hot morning on South Florida's Biscayne Bay, and I've convinced two local tour boat captains to pilot me around the perimeter of what is quite possibly the wealthiest and most heavily defended town in America. I'm not entirely clear on the rules about boating near the island, which lies just across the bay from Miami, and neither are my captains \u2014 they're both in their first weeks on the job. What I do know is that Indian Creek employs a new all-seeing security system and a small navy of police officers who frequently stop and ticket boats that venture too close to the island's manicured shore.\nAs we near the northwestern side of the island, I spot the bright red steel beams of \"La Petite Clef,\" the Mark di Suvero sculpture that towers 20 feet over the front lawn of the car magnate Norman Braman's mansion. We glide past a modern palace hidden behind a dense cluster of palm trees, purchased for $50 million in 2019 by a mysterious LLC linked to the emir of Qatar. On the southwestern shore, we come upon the island's most sought-after mansions. This is where the elite of the elite live: Tom Brady, Carl Icahn, and the neighborhood's most recent arrival, Jeff Bezos. The wealth here is staggering \u2014 25,000-square-foot mansions with ivy-strewn stucco walls, fronted by sprawling lawns and sleek yachts. Today, almost all the mansions appear to be empty.\nAs we get closer to the shore, I start to notice the cameras.\nTheir beady eyes are everywhere. Some are mounted on poles along the seawall. Others peek out from hedges. Many are connected to an inconspicuous white box \u2014 an Israeli-designed radar system capable of detecting passersby, in low visibility, from half a mile away.\nThere is no way for a person to set foot on Indian Creek without the express permission of one of its 89 residents or a member of its ultra exclusive country club, which reportedly costs $500,000 to join. Because the town's government serves such an ultra wealthy subset of the population, things like public parks and social programs are practically nonexistent. Instead, the lion's share of Indian Creek's budget goes to its police department \u2014 which keeps watch on the island's sole entrance and patrols the perimeter 24/7. Through federal funds, the town has also amassed a panoply of other security measures that would make Bezos' Ring cameras blush.\n\"The wealthier you become, the more you want perfect security,\" says Setha Low, the director of the Public Space Research Group, a center at the City University of New York that focuses on the access and control of everything from city parks to gated communities. \"And that produces an industry making a lot of money off of people's fear.\" Much like the military-industrial complex, she says, \"there's a security-industrial complex \u2014 this entire sector of our economy being fed by people wanting this kind of security.\"\nI'm relieved when we pull away before running into an Indian Creek police patrol. But there's no doubt we've been seen. In an increasingly atomized age, the Billionaire Bunker is an increasingly insular and secure enclave. If you want to live in a part of America that no outsiders can set foot in, Indian Creek is the most gated community in a country of gates.\nDredged from the Tiffany-blue waters of Biscayne Bay in 1928, Indian Creek was incorporated in 1939 under a now defunct Florida law that allowed groups of more than 25 people to form their own municipalities. Designed to re-create the English countryside, the 300-acre island is more than 80% golf course, encircled by a single road and 30 or so mansions. The village was initially envisioned as a refuge for wealthy white gentiles. Early residents included William Henry Hoover, of vacuum fame, and Frank Woolworth, the eponymous founder of the department-store chain. Back then, residents conspired to keep Jewish homebuyers out by running their electric services exclusively through the formally segregated Indian Creek Country Club.\nThat system of de facto segregation no longer exists, but Indian Creek remains fixated on keeping certain people out. \"The security is very different than how it used to be,\" says Gerardo Vildostegui, who grew up in the neighboring town of Surfside, a middle-class community that shares a two-lane bridge with Indian Creek. A member of Surfside's town council, Vildostegui recalls a time in the early '90s when he could bring his college friends to Indian Creek's gate and get permission from the police to give them a tour of the island. Now if he approaches the bridge, the cops start flashing their lights and order him to back away.\nIn the 1980s, the island's police force \u2014 whose motto is \"protecting and serving America's most exclusive municipality\" \u2014 was made up of 11 people. Recent town documents show they employ 19, one for every five residents. That's compared with a national average of about 2.4 cops per 1,000 residents. If New York City had the same officer-to-citizen ratio as Indian Creek, it would employ more than 1.5 million cops. Because Indian Creek's denizens are jet-setting billionaires with homes all over the world, there are likely many days of the year when police officers actually outnumber the island's residents.\nIf New York City had the same officer-to-citizen ratio as Indian Creek, it would employ more than 1.5 million cops.\nOften described as \"butlers with badges,\" the Indian Creek police force is unlike most of its counterparts. For starters, it's nonunion. The town government quashed a union drive in the 1980s, firing a lead organizer accused of taking gasoline from a town tank. And rather than responding to calls from citizens in need, the police spend an estimated 97% of their time on security work, like patrolling the island's perimeter in three high-speed police boats and manning the access command center by the bridge. The force's recruitment materials say officers have \"extremely high levels of training in areas such as weapons, defensive tactics, and tactical operations\" and are trained to use fully automatic firearms. All told, the town spent $4.1 million \u2014 a whopping 74% of its budget \u2014 on public safety in fiscal year 2023.\nIn 2011, the town installed new cameras by the entrance gate that allow police to simultaneously view a visitor's face, pull up their driver's license, and read their license plate. Indian Creek also narrowed the gate's opening to create what it called \"a greater sense of exclusivity.\" In 2012 the town replaced the tinted bullet-resistant glass in the access command center, and in 2013 it added a fence to keep pedestrians out. Such investments are generally lauded by residents, who often push the town council for more stringent security measures. \"Safety is our No. 1,\" Irma Braman, Norman's wife, said at one meeting. \"It should be everyone's No. 1.\"\nWhatever crimes the island's residents may be committing, they aren't doing it on the island. Many years, not a single offense is reported to the Indian Creek police. Instead, the cops have their hands full fending off the curious boaters who try to land on the beach near the golf course. \"The police are being run ragged right now,\" Mayor Bernard Klepach \u2014 who is also the CEO of the world's largest in-flight duty-free company \u2014 said at a council meeting in 2020, referring not to a crime wave but to recent incursions by beachgoers. \"We need something quickly.\"\nThat year, Indian Creek began its most substantial security upgrade in decades \u2014 a high-tech radar fence encircling the island. According to public records, the system features 10 thermal cameras and 17 radar sensors mounted at nine locations along the island's perimeter, in addition to 30 traditional cameras. The radar sensors overlap, creating what the records call a \"geofence\" that can detect anything that comes within a half-mile of the shore. The project cost about $1.6 million \u2014 equal to about a quarter of the village's annual budget.\nThe radars were built by Magos, an Israeli company whose founders worked with military radar technology before shifting their focus to private security. Its website says Magos radar systems are generally used in data centers, oil and gas facilities, and solar farms. \"Radar works extremely well in wide-open spaces,\" says Mike Bullman, who runs Safe Security Solutions, a perimeter-security company that has installed Magos radars around large country estates in the United Kingdom. But he and several other security professionals I spoke with had never heard of one being installed around an entire town.\nThe Indian Creek radar can detect objects on the water and use artificial intelligence to classify them according to the risk they pose. When a potential threat is detected, the system automatically moves a thermal camera to track it. Police officers at the station can watch a live feed on a software called \"Octopus,\" and dispatch a patrol boat to investigate.\nJustin Ross, who's been running tours of the Biscayne Bay for several years, first noticed the perimeter-security system while boating past the island one evening in 2022. A red light from the shore appeared to latch on to his boat. \"I could see it moving,\" he recalls. \"I was like, oh wow, it's following me.\"\nWith the new security system, the Indian Creek police appear to have turbocharged their enforcement of regulations in the surrounding waters. In 2019, the department issued 211 traffic and marine citations. In 2022, the first year the radar system was fully operational, the number of citations soared to 1,600.\n\"Every time I go past Indian Creek, I run into a marine patrol guy,\" Ross says. He knows of plenty of boaters who have been ticketed, generally for creating a wake too close to the shore. Passing by the island earlier this year, Ross triggered the attention of an Indian Creek Police patrol. The officer hit him with a $140 ticket for not having the correct safety equipment on board. The Indian Creek police department did not respond to my inquiries.\nResidents, for their part, have been enthusiastic about the new system, and several granted easements to allow the tech to be mounted on their property. One key selling point for the ultra wealthy townies: The cameras would never be pointed inward. Only outsiders would be targeted by the high-tech system. \"I think the security is great and have been happy with what has been implemented,\" Gail Golden, the wife of Carl Icahn, tells me. \"Nothing further to add.\"\nIn August 2023, about a year after the perimeter system was installed, Indian Creek residents learned that they had a new neighbor. Jeff Bezos, the world's second-richest man, had spent $68 million on a waterfront mansion, quickly followed by the purchase of an abutting property worth $79 million. Then, last April, he completed a billionaire's hat trick, grabbing a $90 million mansion from Javier Holtz, the retired chairman and CEO of Marquis Bank. The Amazon tycoon got to work, applying to build a pickleball court in one of his yards and making plans to tear down two of the dwellings to construct one supermansion.\nBezos' arrival catapulted the wealth of Indian Creek into a new stratosphere. In 2014, the entire net worth of the island's 86 residents was estimated at $37 billion. Bezos added $199 billion. The total value of property on the island is approaching $1 billion and seems poised to climb.\n\"People's price expectations just jumped drastically,\" says Marko Gojanovic, a real-estate agent who has shown several houses on the island. Prices have more than doubled since the start of the pandemic and have increased by at least another 20% since the first Bezos deal. Gojanovic says he's been asking as much as $150 million for certain properties.\nFor real-estate agents, Gojanovic says, \"access to Indian Creek is almost like gold.\" In off-market transactions like the Bezos sales, two or three brokers can find themselves pitching the same property. Agents are expected to keep transactions private, and Gojanovic says nondisclosure agreements are common. The true owners of several Indian Creek properties remain undisclosed, including the buyer of a $65 million property purchased this May.\nDina Goldentayer, who served as the broker for one of the Bezos properties, says security has become a major selling point for prospective buyers. \"These people are buying a secure lifestyle as much as they're buying a big house,\" she says.\nIn recent years, the island, which has long served as a haven for the elite, has become even more exclusive. Vildostegui, the Surfside town council member, says Island Creek residents used to feel more like local celebrities \u2014 guys like Don Shula, the coach of the Miami Dolphins, who you might run into at church. Now, Vildostegui says, the island has become \"a spot on the international billionaire circuit.\"\nThe new arrivals have triggered a bit of a building boom, with several projects now under construction. When I visit the entrance on a Tuesday afternoon, I count about 30 vehicles entering and exiting in less than 10 minutes \u2014 the Teslas and BMWs of the residents and country-club members mixed in with the pickups, vans, and Toyotas of construction workers. A sign by the entrance gate reads \"No Trespassing: Private Island,\" and a black police SUV idles nearby.\nDespite the Billionaire Bunker's fixation on remaining insular, it tends to encroach on the outside world. With on-island parking limited to construction supervisors, crews working on Indian Creek mansions sometimes park along a quiet Surfside street near the bridge. Properties in the neighborhood are also being bought up by opaquely named LLCs tied to Indian Creek residents. Julio Iglesias, a longtime Indian Creek homeowner, is particularly invested in Surfside, controlling through several LLCs at least nine properties within a few blocks of the entrance.\nThe sprawl into Surfside became a flashpoint in the late 1990s, when Indian Creek began building a new police and government complex on the other side of the bridge. Some Surfsiders felt the station would change the character of their neighborhood, and the conflict grew petty, bringing long-simmering class tension to the surface. Town officials snubbed each other at community meetings and filed competing lawsuits. \"We used to tease each other that, for them, Surfside was spelled with an E instead of a U,\" says Tim Will, who served as a Surfside commissioner during the spat. \"They don't interact with us unless you're cutting their lawns or building their piers.\"\nWill was particularly bothered by the bridge connecting the two towns, which receives public money for repair projects but which the public is forbidden from crossing. Actually, Indian Creek often makes use of public funds to maintain its privacy \u2014 security projects like the radar system are almost always funded via a federal forfeiture fund.\nIndian Creek eventually won the turf war, and the new police station was built. Tensions with Surfside seem to have cooled, but the questions of public funding and public access remain. The bridge received $875,000 in government grants in 2008, and last November the town requested another $400,000 for repairs. But when I visit the police station at the bridge and ask if I can walk across, I'm barred from entering.\nIndian Creek's growing wealth and security mirror trends among the global superrich. Over the past four years, billionaire wealth has grown by 88%. In April, America's 806 billionaires boasted a net worth of $5.8 trillion, greater than the annual GDPs of Japan, Germany, and India \u2014 and more wealth than the bottom half of America. Miami is frequently said to be the US city with the most extreme income inequality.\nThe growing wealth gap has given rise to the security-industrial complex, a burgeoning field aimed at assuaging the anxieties of the superwealthy. Multiple billionaire-security professionals I spoke with described an increased interest in security among their ultra-high-net-worth clients. Some are shelling out millions on highly trained bodyguards or deploying high-tech surveillance drones. Elon Musk travels with up to 20 bodyguards at a time. Others are building bunkers to wait out the apocalypse. In Indian Creek, if you somehow evaded the islandwide surveillance dragnet that Bezos and his neighbors have amassed through public funding, you'd still have to contend with the formidable private dragnets guarding their individual mansions.\nWalled-off communities, by their very nature, lead to ever higher walls.\nSecurity \"has become a really big concern for billionaires now, because there's never been more talk about the divide between the haves and the have-nots,\" says Brian Daniel, who operates the Celebrity Personal Assistant Network, a company that connects billionaires to security staff. \"It gets people worked up.\" Never mind that poor people are statistically far more likely to be the victims of crime than those who can afford supermansions on private islands. Being rich means you can afford to be safe instead of sorry.\n\"Trapped,\" a book coauthored by Low, the CUNY researcher, describes a growing movement to build communities that are \"privatized, fortified, unequal.\" By 2015, more than 11 million Americans had retreated to these \"secured communities,\" compared with 7 million a decade earlier. But rather than making residents feel safer, Low says, the intense focus on security and privacy only serves to cut them off from the public and stoke their anxieties about outsiders. Walled-off communities, by their very nature, lead to ever higher walls.\n\"Indian Creek is a great extreme example of trying to pull out completely from having anything to do with the rest of the world,\" Low says. \"The more you enclose yourself, the more you're reminding yourself of a sense of risk.\"\nAt a council meeting in 2022, not long after the installation of the perimeter-security system, Indian Creek residents were once again discussing the need to ramp up their security. This time, they worried the threat might be coming from inside the mansions. The police chief, John Bernardo, proposed a measure that would require any worker entering the island to submit to a criminal background check. Despite pushback from some residents who were concerned that the policy would make hiring more difficult, the council came down largely in support of the idea.\nFor Mayor Klepach, the background checks were just a starting point. More wealth leads to more workers \u2014 and every worker is a potential threat.\"Especially when you have so many houses going up and a caravan of employees coming in and out of here,\" the mayor said, \"we could do so much more.\"\nGuthrie Scrimgeour is an investigative journalist based in Washington, DC, covering wealth and power.",
